Do we have to strip Skoda of all that is good and excellent that we have now?"" Povsik said in a front-page article in the union's weekly bulletin, Skodovacky Odborar.""We will fight on all fronts - in the press, with the government, via the public, at Volkswagen, everywhere,"" he said.Last year, Skoda made 29,298 Superbs, 101,586 Kodiaqs and 98,370 Seat Atecas at its plants in the Czech Republic.Globally, the company delivered 1.24 million cars in 2019, with China and Germany as its top markets. Like other carmakers, Skoda is battling to get back from shutdowns due to the coronavirus crisis and now faces uncertainty over demand.Volkswagen group Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) in July that Skoda - one of VW's 12 brands - needed to do more to compete with South Korean and French rivals.(Reporting by Robert Muller; editing by Philippa Fletcher)"
