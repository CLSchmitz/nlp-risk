[nL8N2DL31G]Gomorek also pointed to Italy ""where Lufthansa has its subsidiary, we have that subsidiary talking about getting together with three other airlines to discuss and maybe agree what price levels they may feel comfortable at.""The European Commission said it had received the complaint and would assess it.Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines declined to comment.Gomorek last week wrote to European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's head of cabinet Kim Jorgensen calling for action against Lufthansa's Air Dolomiti, Alitalia, Neos and Blue Panorama, according to the letter seen by Reuters.($1 = 0.8915 euros)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, additional reporting by Ilona Wissenbach in Frankfurt and Kirsti Knolle in Vienna; Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Edmund Blair)"
