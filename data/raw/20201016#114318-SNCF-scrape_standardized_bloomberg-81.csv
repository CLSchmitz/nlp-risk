Police estimate that 16,000 people marched against the plan in Paris Thursday while unions say 55,000 showed up, Agence France-Presse reported. That’s down from estimates of 24,000 and 60,000 on Sept. 12 and compares with the figures of 70,000 and 200,000 for June 2016 demonstrations against President Francois Hollande’s labor market fix. Trains ran broadly as usual throughout the day, rail operator SNCF said.     The low turnout is a blow to the CGT union, the main holdout against the reforms, and suggests that Macron has all but completed the first step in his plan to revamp the euro area’s second-largest economy. Speaking after his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York late Wednesday, the 39-year-old president said his election victories in May and June gave him the legitimacy to push through the reforms.    {""contentId"":""OWMWCT6KLVRK01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2017-09-21/turnout-for-paris-protests-against-macron-s-labor-law-declines""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-OWMWCT6KLVRK01""}   {""contentId"":""OWMWCT6KLVRK01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2017-09-21/turnout-for-paris-protests-against-macron-s-labor-law-declines""},""containerId"":""box-gyq8nXP""}   “The people made their choice, made their decisions, it’s normal that they’re applied,” Macron said after his UN address.

As focus shifts from this particular labor issue to budget cuts and other economic adjustments, far-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon will hold his own set of demonstrations across the country Saturday. On Monday truck drivers will begin a rolling strike in which they try to choke traffic and limit access to gasoline supplies. Government employees have scheduled a strike for Oct. 10.  “When he speaks of the streets it has very strong connotations,” Melenchon said Thursday on RTL radio. “An election isn’t a blank check.”  {""contentId"":""OWMWCT6KLVRK01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2017-09-21/turnout-for-paris-protests-against-macron-s-labor-law-declines""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-OWMWCT6KLVRK01""}   — With assistance by Rudy Ruitenberg  (Adds Macron, Melenchon starting in third paragraph.)
