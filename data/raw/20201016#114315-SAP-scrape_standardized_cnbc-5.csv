It will not seek state aid or put any of its 100,000 staff on short-time work, Mucic said.The company will conduct no further share buybacks in 2020 having completed a repurchase program worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion), he added.SAP stood by its mid-term goal of expanding its profit margin by one percentage point per year through 2023 as more customers switch to running business processes, such as finance or supply chain management, on cloud-based servers.“We are very confident that we will again emerge as a stronger company and clear leader after the crisis,” said Mucic, who recently received a contract extension.
