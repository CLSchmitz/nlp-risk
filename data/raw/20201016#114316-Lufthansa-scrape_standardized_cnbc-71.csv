MessageBird founder and CEO Robert Vis said his company is also more dominant in Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America, whereas Twilio is “very U.S.-focused.” Twilio was not immediately available for comment on this when contacted by CNBC.MessageBird claims to have over 15,000 clients globally, including Lufthansa, SAP and Uber, but is still dwarfed by its U.S. counterpart. According to Twilio’s website, the company has more than 150,000 customers, from Twitter to Yelp. Its market cap, of over $40 billion, is also nearly 15 times that of MessageBird’s.
