RBC predicts companies positioned to do well in  transformation include Avago Technologies, Google and Newell  Rubbermaid.  The next theme is cyclical opportunities. ”Despite the lackluster environment for  economically-sensitive stocks, we see opportunities to invest in  high-quality cyclical companies, where negative sentiment in  their sectors has created an undue discount to their  longer-term franchise value.”  The companies that could benefit from such opportunities include Brookfield  Asset Management, CBOE Holdings  and Whirlpool.Finally, the higher rates and  a normalization of interest rate policies will benefit  course businesses like PNC Financial Services  and Toronto-Dominion Bank."
