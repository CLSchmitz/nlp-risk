Gounon would like to see German train operator Deutsche Bahn AG get approval from the U.K. and French governments to run such “distributed-drive” trains through the tunnel by the 2012 London Olympics, the newspaper said. Alstom SA and the French government protested when train operator Eurostar Group Ltd. decided in October to buy Siemens trains that don’t comply with the tunnel’s current safety requirements, Le Figaro said.
