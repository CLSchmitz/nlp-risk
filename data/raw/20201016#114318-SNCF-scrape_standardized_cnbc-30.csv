If all goes to plan, the project, which is called 1000start-ups,  will see 1,000 entrepreneurs share a currently unused building,  which will be equipped with working spaces, a big auditorium,  several boardrooms and a “fab lab” (a small-scale workshop  equipped to make digital prototypes). Paris’s city council will  contribute 70 million euros ($94.5 million) to acquire the  building, which is currently owned by the state-owned railway  service, SNCF.

The  area is already known as Paris’s “Silicon Sentier”, with several  existing incubators and two R&D-focused universities.  “Paris is a magical city, a city that attracts people from around  the world and where a real energy around digital is developing.  But young companies that want to settle there are faced with a  lack of affordable, practical and high-speed equipped  places,“Xavier Niel, a French entrepreneur and co-financer of the  project, told Journal du Dimanche newspaper.   Incubators are not new to theFrench capital. At present, around  550 start-ups are run from Parisianincubators, where they benefit  from services such as low-rent business space.
