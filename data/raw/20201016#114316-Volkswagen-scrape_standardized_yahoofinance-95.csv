Porsche Automobil Holding SE further said it would pay the 1.5 million euros to settle the case.In Germany, payments can be accepted by prosecutors in exchange for dropping criminal charges.Prosecutors had looked at whether executives at the holding company that controls Volkswagen (VW) manipulated markets by delaying the disclosure of VW’s emissions scandal in 2015.The Stuttgart prosecutor’s office launched the probe at the behest of markets regulator BaFin, but Volkswagen executives have argued the scale of the financial fallout from diesel cheating was not forseeable.(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Writing by Edward Taylor; Editing by Madeline Chambers)
