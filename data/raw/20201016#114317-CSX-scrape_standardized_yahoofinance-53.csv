But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. It has returned a market beating 86% in that time. View our latest analysis for CSX To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, CSX managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 13% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).<img alt=""NasdaqGS:CSX Past and Future Earnings April 8th 2020"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lTPK2eV5QzDRk2UdOtDrRA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/1b6e87f22811189c724a55af68d876e2"" class=""caas-img"">NasdaqGS:CSX Past and Future Earnings April 8th 2020We know that CSX has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of CSX, it has a TSR of 104% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 8.1% in the twelve months, CSX shareholders did even worse, losing 17% (even including dividends) . However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 15%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.
