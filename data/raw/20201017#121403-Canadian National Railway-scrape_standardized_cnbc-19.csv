No one was injured in the incident which involved the derailment  of 21 railcars, eight of which have spilled their contents, a  Canadian National Railway spokesman said.  Several of the cars were carrying hazardous materials including  fertilizer and methanol, but there was no fire, he said.

Emergency services were on the scene and responding to the  accident, local officials said.  Local sheriff Jimmy Dale Smith said that fewer than 20 people  have had to be evacuated at last count.  “They’ve got these spills pretty much contained and secured, and  we’re working on starting the cleanup process at this point,”  Smith said from the scene. “Hopefully we can get everything  cleaned up this afternoon and get people in their homes tonight.”  Friday’s accident follows a spate of explosive derailments of  trains carrying crude oil over the past year that has raised  questions about safety, especially of some older tank cars prone  to puncture.

Last July, a runaway oil train derailed and exploded in the  center of the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic, killing 47 people.  --By Reuters"
