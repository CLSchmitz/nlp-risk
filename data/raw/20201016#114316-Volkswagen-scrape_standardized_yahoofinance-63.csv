The accusations against Winterkorn are limited in scope and relate to a specific instance in time, the lawyer added.Volkswagen said that while it was no longer the target of prosecutors after settling charges, it wanted to emphasize that all of the accused were innocent until proven guilty.Volkswagen also said it had taken extensive measures to change processes, systems and controls to improve compliance in the wake of the emissions scandal.(Reporting by Jan Schwartz in Braunschweig; writing by Edward Taylor; editing by Mark Potter)
