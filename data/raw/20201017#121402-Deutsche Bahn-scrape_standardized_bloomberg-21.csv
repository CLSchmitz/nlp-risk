The EU’s Court of Justice ruled today that the fees set by MasterCard had unfairly restricted competition and that it failed to show benefits to justify its system. The judgment may spur legal proceedings against card levies across Europe, including the U.K.’s stalled antitrust probe and lawsuits by retailers. EU lawmakers and governments are also weighing limits on the charges.     “MasterCard ought to reduce its fees pretty much immediately,” said Ruth Milligan, a legal adviser to European retailers’ group EuroCommerce, whose members include Carrefour SA and Ikea Group, the world’s largest furniture seller. The ruling gives “absolute legal certainty” for EU limits on interchange fees, which generate 9 billion euros ($11.6 billion) in revenue every year, she said. While the case targeted cross-border fees in Europe, it should pave the way for cuts to more lucrative domestic fees, she said.    {""contentId"":""NBP1CS6KLVRP01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-09-11/mastercard-loses-fight-at-top-eu-court-over-card-levies""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-NBP1CS6KLVRP01""}   {""contentId"":""NBP1CS6KLVRP01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2014-09-11/mastercard-loses-fight-at-top-eu-court-over-card-levies""},""containerId"":""box-HQ3ytDo""}   The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority will decide by the end of next month on what to do with its stalled antitrust probe into domestic fees charged by MasterCard and Visa Europe, said Rory Taylor, a spokesman for the regulator.    ‘Disappointing’ Ruling  MasterCard Europe’s president Javier Perez said that while the ruling was “disappointing,” it “will have little or no impact on how MasterCard operates” because it has been complying with EU limits on cross-border fees of 0.2 percent for debit card payments and 0.3 percent for credit cards.  {""contentId"":""NBP1CS6KLVRP01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-09-11/mastercard-loses-fight-at-top-eu-court-over-card-levies""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-NBP1CS6KLVRP01""}   MasterCard said in a statement the EU’s setting of fees at that level in both its antitrust decision and draft legislation was “arbitrary” and may lead to consumers paying higher banking fees.  {""contentId"":""NBP1CS6KLVRP01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-09-11/mastercard-loses-fight-at-top-eu-court-over-card-levies""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-NBP1CS6KLVRP01""}   The company earlier this week won a court clash with regulators who refused to hand over a study comparing the costs of bank cards with cash. MasterCard said it’s crucial the research be made public to show how the EU has set the caps.  MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, argues that consumers would lose out if it were forced to abandon the so-called interchange fees, which it says share out the costs of card payments between retailers and consumers.  Consumer Group  “Today’s ruling is a big win for European consumers,” Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission, told reporters in Brussels today.  {""contentId"":""NBP1CS6KLVRP01"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2014-09-11/mastercard-loses-fight-at-top-eu-court-over-card-levies""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-NBP1CS6KLVRP01""}   Consumer advocacy group BEUC sees the interchange fees as “unfair transaction” costs that prevent lower prices and innovation, Johannes Kleis, a spokesman for the Brussels organization said in an e-mail.  EU regulators have targeted credit- and debit-card fees for more than a decade and last year started a formal probe into MasterCard’s charges on foreign card payments such as when tourists go shopping in the 28-nation bloc.  Visa Europe, operator of the EU’s largest payment-card network, pledged to reduce credit-card fees to end a similar antitrust investigation earlier this year.  MasterCard faces U.K. lawsuits from retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Asda and J Sainsbury Plc as well as a claim from Deutsche Bahn AG seeking compensation for “unlawful” interchange fees.  Binding Decision  The ruling from the EU’s top court is binding and can’t be appealed. MasterCard lost an earlier appeal at the EU’s General Court in 2012.  {""contentId"":""NBP1CS6KLVRP01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-09-11/mastercard-loses-fight-at-top-eu-court-over-card-levies""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-2-NBP1CS6KLVRP01""}   MasterCard’s case was backed by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc.  While the MasterCard ruling signals a victory for the commission, the Brussels-based regulator suffered a setback in another bank-card case today.  The top court ordered a re-examination of a 2007 decision that forced a French group of banks, including BNP Paribas SA, Societe Generale SA and HSBC, to scrap debit-card fees deemed to prevent competitors from issuing cards at cheaper rates.  {""contentId"":""NBP1CS6KLVRP01"",""position"":""in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article2"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2014-09-11/mastercard-loses-fight-at-top-eu-court-over-card-levies""},""containerId"":""in-article-2-NBP1CS6KLVRP01""}   Judges said a lower EU court that threw out a challenge “did not correctly assess” that the intent of debit-card fees imposed by the Groupement des Cartes Bancaires on members was anti-competitive. The EU’s General Court must now examine the fees’ effects to determine if they curtailed competition.  The commission “will carefully study this judgment,” Colombani said. The ruling “raises important questions” about what activities can be seen as anti-competitive per se without examining the effects.  The cases are: C-382/12 P MasterCard and Others v. Commission; C-67/13 CB v Commission  (Updates with European Commission comment in penultimate paragraph.)
