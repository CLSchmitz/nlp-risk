Fresh coronavirus cases have been on the rise since the economy started reopening and now experts claim that the numbers could further rise in the days to come.Fears of a second wave of coronavirus are looming already and it won’t come as a surprise if people once again start staying at home. Two months of at-home orders following the coronavirus outbreak have changed the way lives were led in the pre-COVID-19 era. With no signs of the virus receding, life has become a lot more technology dependent and in all likelihood will remain so.New COVID-19 Cases Hit Record HighOn Jul 1, United States recorded a whopping 52,000 new COVOD-19 cases, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. Several states also imposed 14-day quarantines on visitors in the buildup to Jul 4 celebrations and the long weekend. The record follows a warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci — head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — that the number could soon double to 100,000 cases a day if Americans do not take necessary action to contain the spread of the virus.More than 50% of new U.S. cases come from Arizona, California, Florida and Texas, which is home to 30% of the country’s population. The recent increase can be traced back to the Memorial Day holiday celebrations in late May. Health experts are worried about Independence Day celebrations this weekend, when Americans traditionally flock to beaches and campgrounds to watch fireworks’ displays.Will Tech Dependence Surge?The world has witnessed how technology has become mankind’s savior and a favorite companion in the peak of the outbreak. The pandemic over the last couple of months has led to record sales of laptops, tablets, video games, and computer hardware and networking software. Also there has been an unprecedented spike in downloading of video-streaming apps, and those that aid in working and learning from remote locations.Story continuesMoreover, technology has also helped save the retail sector from a total collapse, thanks to e-commerce. It has also saved to some extent major industries like travel, aviation and automobiles that took a massive hit due to the pandemic.With many states now contemplating pushing back the reopening phase, people are once again likely to spend more time in their homes and depend on technology to fulfill their daily tasks. Many at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak had predicted that the tech rally would come to a halt after more than two years of driving the markets. Clearly, they have been proven wrong.Increased dependence on technology has once again boosted the prospects of these stocks.
