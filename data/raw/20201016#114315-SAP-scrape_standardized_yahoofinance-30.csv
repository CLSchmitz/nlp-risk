""We are in it for the long run,"" he told reporters on a conference call.Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said details were still to be worked out, noting it was typical for stock market offerings of tech companies to comprise a stake of 10%-15%.The goal, Mucic added, would be to capitalise Qualtrics properly while giving SAP greater latitude to invest in developing its own business or make smaller ""tuck-in"" acquisitions.
