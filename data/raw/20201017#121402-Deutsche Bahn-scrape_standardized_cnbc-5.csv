While the Solihull development has placed a focus on renewables and sustainable design, some organizations have raised concerns regarding the wider impact of the HS2 project on wildlife and those living near the route. For its part, HS2 says it will, among other things, plant millions of trees on the route as well as fund woodland in other parts of the country.  Train stations can often provide engineers and architects with the opportunity to develop innovative buildings that incorporate visually-striking designs and eco-friendly aspects. Over in Germany, for instance, Deutsche Bahn says that the country’s 15 largest stations – in major cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt am Main and Hanover – have been running on green electricity since the start of 2019. Through a pilot scheme called “StationGreen” the firm has also developed two train stations – opened in 2014 and 2016 – that use energy derived from solar power and geothermal heat and have green roofs that boost insulation and harvest rain.  Back in the U.K., Blackfriars Station, in the heart of London, uses electricity generated by more than 4,400 solar photovoltaic panels  installed on a bridge that carries trains over the River Thames. And it’s not just the stations and infrastructure surrounding them that is changing: trains themselves are starting to turn toward interesting sources of power. European railway manufacturer Alstom’s hydrogen-fuel-cell train, for example, started running in September 2018.
