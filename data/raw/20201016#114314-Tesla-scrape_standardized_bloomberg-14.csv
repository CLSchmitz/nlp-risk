Source: Hyundai    Source: Hyundai   Hyundai Motor Group will invest S$400 million ($294 million) in a new innovation center in Singapore that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said may produce up to 30,000 vehicles a year by 2025.    “Automotive activities are becoming viable in Singapore once again,” Lee said in a speech Tuesday to mark the virtual groundbreaking ceremony for the center in the city-state’s west. Electric vehicles “have a different supply chain, fewer mechanical parts and more electronics, which plays to Singapore’s strengths.”    {""contentId"":""QHXHULDWX2Q801"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-13/hyundai-s-new-singapore-hub-may-make-electric-cars-pm-lee-says""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QHXHULDWX2Q801""}   {""contentId"":""QHXHULDWX2Q801"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-13/hyundai-s-new-singapore-hub-may-make-electric-cars-pm-lee-says""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QHXHULDWX2Q801""}   Read more: After Dismissing Musk’s Jibes, Singapore Is Welcoming EVs     {""contentId"":""QHXHULDWX2Q801"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-13/hyundai-s-new-singapore-hub-may-make-electric-cars-pm-lee-says""},""containerId"":""box-4b42eyK""}   The seven-story building, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, is where Hyundai will work on developing artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies to enhance its manufacturing processes, fine tuning the “brains” behind the smarter and more environmentally friendly cars of tomorrow. The center will also have a 620 meter (0.4 mile) driving track near its roof so customers can test-drive vehicles.

The company is separately developing flying cars, planning a full lineup of aerial vehicles that it envisages zigzagging city skies within a decade.  {""contentId"":""QHXHULDWX2Q801"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-13/hyundai-s-new-singapore-hub-may-make-electric-cars-pm-lee-says""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QHXHULDWX2Q801""}   Read more: Hyundai Confident on Flying Cars, Steps Up Plans for Full Lineup  The innovation center will also house a small scale EV production facility to test processes using AI and autonomous driving. One of the company’s EVs, the Kona, has been recalled in South Korea following multiple reports of battery fires.  “We hope this will open up new growth areas for our economy, and create exciting jobs for Singaporeans, for example industrial Internet of Things engineers, data scientists, cobot technicians and digital supply chain strategists,” Lee said.  {""contentId"":""QHXHULDWX2Q801"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-13/hyundai-s-new-singapore-hub-may-make-electric-cars-pm-lee-says""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QHXHULDWX2Q801""}   Lee also said the center marked “an important milestone in the economic relationship between Singapore and South Korea,” paving the way for more Korean firms to invest in the city-state and partner with local suppliers.  Singapore hasn’t had a car manufacturing plant since Ford Motor Co. closed its factory several decades ago, effectively ending automobile production on the island. In October last year, vacuum cleaner maker Dyson Ltd. abandoned a $2.5 billion plan to build electric cars in the city-state because it couldn’t find a way of making the project commercially viable.  Tesla Inc., the world’s biggest maker of EVs, has plans to export China-built Model 3 cars to Singapore and other places in Asia and Europe from its factory in Shanghai, people familiar with the matter said last month.  — With assistance by Joyce Koh   Published on ‎13‎ ‎October‎, ‎2020‎ ‎07‎:‎00        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
