JPMorgan was not listed as an underwriter on that deal, filings from the time show.Representatives for SAP, Qualtrics, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.An IPO could value Qualtrics, which measures and generates reports on customer and employee satisfaction, at as much as 16 billion euros ($18.9 billion), according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysis, more than twice what SAP agreed to pay in late 2018 in its biggest-ever acquisition.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.
