""This will allow us to continue building out the XM ecosystem across a broad array of partners.”A final decision on the IPOs conditions and timings is yet to be announced.Why It MattersSAP had purchased the Utah-based firm in 2018 for $8 billion just before it was set to go public, at a $2.5 billion premium. At the time, the XM software firm had over 9,000 customers, such as Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (OTC: BMWYY), Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS), and the U.S. Air Force, the Financial Times reported.Had Qualtrics gone public in 2018, it would have raised approximately $4.5 billion at the upper end of the $18-$21 per share indicated range for the offering.SAP said in the statement that the U.S. firm has been able to operate with greater independence within the German software giant’s cloud portfolio than other companies that it had previously acquired.Price Action SAP shares closed 1.6% lower at $158.62 in New York on Friday. Photo courtesy: TechCrunchSee more from BenzingaNRG Energy To Purchase Centrica US Unit For .6BMall Operator Simon And Authentic Brands Jointly Make 5M Stalking Horse Bid For Bankrupt Brooks BrothersAmazon Looks To Acquire A Near 10% Stake In Reliance Retail, After Facebook, Google Back Sister Company Jio© 2020 Benzinga.com.
