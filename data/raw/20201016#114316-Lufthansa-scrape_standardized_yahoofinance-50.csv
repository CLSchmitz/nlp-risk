Yahoo Finance’s On The Move panel discusses.Video TranscriptADAM SHAPIRO: Let's head to London. Oscar Williams-Grut is following what's going on with Lufthansa and has the latest for us as that airline faces insolvency. Oscar.OSCAR WILLIAMS-GRUT: Well, not quite. There's a crunch vote coming up later this week which could-- basically the fate of the German airline hangs in the balance. Now, the shares have come under pressure today, down as much as 5% earlier today after reports over the weekend that this state bailout that they've been trying to line up for months could be in doubt. The German state was planning to take a 20% stake in Lufthansa for around $10 billion.But Lufthansa's biggest shareholder, Heinz Hermann Thiele, is unhappy with the terms of the deal. He doesn't want his holdings to be diluted-- he owns about 15% of the airline-- and also doesn't want the government to get a board seat here, essentially seeing him being pushed out here. Instead, he wants to see a similar arrangement to what's happened in France with their national airline where they've been aided through loans rather than an equity stake.Now, Thiele is meeting with the German finance ministry today to hold crunch talks about trying to reach some agreement. But as I said, this key vote is coming up on Thursday as to whether shareholders will approve it. All signs so far point to Thiele holding the balance of power in this one, so really all eyes are on these talks with the government.So far there's been no official word from either Lufthansa or the German finance ministry. However, the shares have recovered somewhat. They're down just over 3% the last I checked.
