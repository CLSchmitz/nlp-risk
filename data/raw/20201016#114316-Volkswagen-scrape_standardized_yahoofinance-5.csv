The debut in September of Volkswagen’s highly anticipated ID.3 model vaulted it to the top of the Norwegian sales ranking, outselling California-based Tesla‘s Model 3 and Geely‘s Polestar 2 from China, according to the Norwegian Road Federation, Reuters reported.At the time of writing, Volkswagen’s shares traded 1.43% to EUR139.44 on Wednesday; however, the stock is down over 20% so far this year.Volkswagen stock forecastFourteen analysts forecast the average price in 12 months at EUR 159.31 with a high forecast of EUR 190.00 and a low forecast of EUR 135.00. The average price target represents a 15.72% increase from the last price of EUR 137.67. From those 14, nine analysts rated “Buy”, three rated “Hold” and two rated “Sell”, according to Tipranks.Morgan Stanley target price is EUR 135 with a high of EUR 180 under a bull scenario and EUR 90 under the worst-case scenario. Volkswagen has been assigned a EUR 145 target price by stock analysts at Jefferies Financial Group. The firm presently has a “neutral” rating on the stock.Other equity analysts also recently updated their stock outlook. Barclays set a EUR 155 price target and gave the company a “buy” rating. Deutsche Bank set a EUR 170 price target and gave the company a “buy” rating. Royal Bank of Canada set a EUR 175 price target and gave the company a “buy” rating. Warburg Research set a EUR 190 price target and gave the company a “buy” rating. At last, Nord/LB set a EUR 135 price objective and gave the company a “neutral” rating.Story continuesAnalyst view“Volkswagen (VW) is the No. 1 global auto OEM. Strong positioning, a strong SUV model cycle, and improved cost management have all supported the recent earnings streams. The upside is capped by peak cycle demand, slowing China demand, European cycle risks, and European and global emissions legislation forcing VW to reduce CO2 and accelerate BEV development,” said Harald Hendrikse, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.“Volkswagen is the leading BEV legacy OEM -but it remains a very small proportion of sales and capital, with a very large legacy cost base. Ex FY20E, EPS has been near record highs, and VW remains the consensual Buy in the European sector for now. On lower FY20E EPS, valuation is not cheap.”Upside and Downside risksUpside: 1) Volkswagen margins and FCF recover more fully in FY21E than we forecast. 2) BEV sales accelerate more sharply in FY21E. 3) Volkswagen’s rating starts to reflect some BEV sustainability as BEV sales accelerate – highlighted by Morgan Stanley.Downside: 1) Emissions regulations impact through further regulatory fines & or other liabilities. 2) Sharp decline in global demand/pricing could undermine margins more significantly.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE: E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Technical Analysis – Straddling Key Retracement Zone  Apple Accused of Anti-Competitive Behavior  Crude Oil Price Forecast – Crude Oil Markets Gapped Lower  Natural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Continue to Trade Range  GBP/USD Price Forecast – British Pound Continues to Look Heavy  Volkswagen Expects 90% Electric Car Sales in 2021; Target Price $159 "
