I’ll continue to be a friend, follow very closely and be involved at some capacity. It was just that when the NFX folks came knocking — this was obvious.”Beller said she will continue to keep an interest in blockchain technology at NFX, but that she’s open to investing in a variety of technologies. “The crazy, weird, creative folks who are contrarians and see the world as broken or see the world differently than other people, those are the people I want to speak to,” she said. Since its founding in 2015, NFX has kept its focus on companies that have the potential for network effects, meaning their value and capabilities increase as more and more users join. The firm focuses its investments in U.S. and Israeli companies, said James Currier, NFX general partner. Beller “is the kind of person who comes into venture once every 10 or 15 years,” Currier said. “The maturity, intellect, curiosity, the network, the connections, the understanding of new markets — it’s very rare for a person to have all that.”
