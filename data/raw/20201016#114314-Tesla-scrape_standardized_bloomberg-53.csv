Tesla’s slice of the “mainstream” electric-vehicle market will significantly decrease in five to 10 years, he said.     {""contentId"":""QH9C5RDWLU6A01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-27/tesla-s-25-000-car-doesn-t-worry-its-biggest-rivals-in-china""},""containerId"":""box-hhOBJ6O""}   Where WM Motor will be by 2030 isn’t certain either. The company earlier this month raised $1.5 billion in a Series D round led by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. (Group), the parent of China’s biggest automaker SAIC Motor Corp. People familiar with the matter have said WM plans a stock-market listing in its hometown of Shanghai as soon as this year, something Shen indicated on Saturday sounded ambitious, but declined to comment on further.    Xpeng Inc. Vice Chairman Brian Gu meanwhile described Tesla as a partner, with both EV manufacturers trying to attract consumers with smart, environmentally friendly cars. EVs are “less than 5% of the market,” and together they “are accelerating that change and conversion,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.  Faster Growth  Gu also said Tesla’s plan to expand its output in Shanghai to an annual capacity of 1 million vehicles in the coming years wasn’t of concern. If Musk achieves it, “that means the market has grown so much faster and bigger than what we anticipated,” Gu said, adding that Xpeng’s mid-range EVs come in around the $25,000 mark already.

The firm is among a handful of Chinese car startups to tap the market, surfing a wave of investor demand for EV stocks. Li Auto Inc., another Chinese EV company, increased the size of its U.S. IPO in July to raise $1.3 billion.  {""contentId"":""QH9C5RDWLU6A01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-27/tesla-s-25-000-car-doesn-t-worry-its-biggest-rivals-in-china""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QH9C5RDWLU6A01""}   Flying Cars — and Face Masks — at Only Major Auto Show of 2020  {""contentId"":""QH9C5RDWLU6A01"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-27/tesla-s-25-000-car-doesn-t-worry-its-biggest-rivals-in-china""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QH9C5RDWLU6A01""}   Tesla’s presence at the Beijing Auto Show was primarily centered around displaying its China-made Model 3. The Palo Alto, California-based company plans to ship cars made at its Shanghai factory to Europe and other countries in Asia, including Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, as soon as the end of this year or early 2021, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.

Chief Executive Officer William Li, when asked about Tesla’s plans for a $25,000 car, noted that battery costs have been steadily declining. Batteries currently represent about one-quarter of an EV’s cost because of the expensive metals used.  “We reached a gross margin of close to 10% in the second quarter and it will increase each quarter,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Saturday. “The overall battery cost decrease will help promote EVs. Our price tag is more than $60,000 and even in China we have a lot of work to do for this niche market.”                   NIO Chairman and CEO William Li discussed demand for the company’s third model. (Source: Bloomberg)   Shanghai-based NIO, which has received a municipal government cash injection and credit facilities from local banks this year, reported a positive gross margin for the first time in the second quarter.  Li also talked about customer service being more important than volume.

Quality and service will be the biggest challenge for all automakers in rapid expansion.”  NIO is also working closely with U.S. companies despite the strained relations between China and the U.S., he said.
