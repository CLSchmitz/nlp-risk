Sign up here.    Today’s Agenda The true coronavirus  death toll is unknowable. Ruth Ginsburg could  teach us how to comport ourselves. We’re still  not worried enough about climate change. Banning TikTok  won’t help national security.  The Covid Count  About seven months ago, the U.S. suffered its first known coronavirus death. Three months later, the official toll had risen to 100,000. Now that number has  doubled — and it’s probably an undercount.    The trouble is that  counting deaths from Covid-19 is far more difficult than it may seem, Faye Flam reminds us. There’s no one national standard for deciding what counts as a coronavirus death. Many pandemic victims have died without ever testing positive for the disease. And should we count the people who died from illnesses that went untreated because the ICU was filled with coronavirus patients? No matter how you make the official tally, though, it is probably already much higher than 200,000.    {""contentId"":""QH10SNT0AFBL01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-09-21/200-000-coronavirus-deaths-is-an-undercount""},""containerId"":""box-pcyLZ4l""}   For various reasons — including the heroic efforts of caregivers and medical researchers — the disease has at least gotten a little less deadly lately. But knock furiously on wood when you read that. The U.S. keeps tempting fate by taking unnecessary chances. For example, did we really need a Nascar race with 30,000 fans? And sending students back to college has been a nationwide superspreading event, Bloomberg’s editorial board writes. With no real guidance from health officials, strapped colleges have rushed back to normalcy too quickly, relying on kids to do the right thing and avoid keg stands and body shots for once. That has gone as well as you’d expect.

India Must First Beat Bangladesh      Twitter’s Huntergate Call Was the Right One      A Private Equity Giant Thinks Workers Should Be Owners Too    It wasn’t long after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday that the discussion about her Supreme Court seat devolved into a political  food fight. To some extent, this was as she might have wanted it: Her last request involved the process of picking her successor. But Ginsburg became  a giant of American public life through intelligent, reasonable persuasion, writes Bloomberg’s editorial board. She showed this approach can change a nation’s minds and direction more than virulent disagreement. It’s a lesson we might struggle to remember in the weeks to come.  Because the  politics of the high court have gotten truly ugly, writes Stephen Carter. Maybe it’s time to rethink basing our judicial system, and maybe our very democracy, on the health of individual justices.  Further RBG Reading:  She  championed the ignored and the excluded, including at one point me. — Cass Sunstein She was wrong that the  Hobby Lobby decision would lead to havoc, fortunately. — Ramesh Ponnuru  Climate Apocalypse Now  Once upon a time, many of us assumed the perils of climate change would appear in an orderly, manageable fashion. It would get hotter and the seas would rise, sure, but we would have time to cope with such predictable nuisances. The wildfires engulfing the West Coast on basically an annual basis already are grim evidence  we got global warming all wrong, writes Noah Smith. This should be a wake-up call that we need aggressive action on climate change, and yesterday.  Unfortunately, the evidence of catastrophe all around us  isn’t exactly galvanizing people into action, writes Clara Ferreira Marques. As always, human psychology is an impediment. People can get used to basically anything, apparently, including Armageddon. We’ll need new approaches to change minds, or prepare for things to get far worse in a hurry.  As the TikTok Turns   Because it is a day that ends in “y,” we’ve had yet another twist in the Trump-TikTok saga. Over the weekend it seemed almost a done deal that Oracle would “partner” with the video-sharing app in the U.S., making sure its Chinese owners didn’t do anything nefarious with its user data. Tae Kim wrote this was a  far cry from the sort of deal President Donald Trump had wanted, with China still holding a very big stake. Who knows, maybe Trump read Tae’s piece; for whatever reason the president today said he  didn’t like the deal after all. So once again it’s possible the world’s hottest social-media app will be banned in the U.S., although that may not survive court challenges.  Anyway, banning TikTok and WeChat as Trump wants to do will only force people to  find alternative, possibly shadier, ways to access those apps, warns Elaine Ou. This could be far worse for user and national security than the status quo.
