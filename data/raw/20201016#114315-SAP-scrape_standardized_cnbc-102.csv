This follows history - when there was the Greek debt crisis or the China growth crisis, the global footprint of SAP and our solutions to help customers seemed to be in the mix of growth because they need our software to navigate through these choppy waters. So it makes SAP a very resilient asset in the software industry, Bill McDermott told CNBC.  SAP reported better then expected quarterly operating profit on  Wednesday, helped by a rise in software licenses, especially in  Europe.      Second-quarter operating profit, excluding special items, rose 9  percent to 1.52 billion euros ($1.67 billion), beating average  analysts’ expectations of 1.45 billion euros in a Reuters poll.  McDermott said it had been an “interesting quarter.”“We’ve had a  trifecta of software revenue growth, cloud revenue growth and operating income all in double digits which is clearly like no other company in our industry,” Bill McDermott said on  Wednesday.
