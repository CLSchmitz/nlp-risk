The cuts under consideration for September would be on top of measures already publicly announced, NZZ am Sonntag said.    {""contentId"":""QFV3IAT1UM0W01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-30/lufthansa-said-to-weigh-more-cuts-to-jobs-costs-nzzams""},""containerId"":""box-o2dzvCD""}   A spokesman for Lufthansa, which employed more than 138,000 people as of Dec. 31, denied the report when contacted by Bloomberg. The newspaper also cited a spokesman as saying there were no new job reduction plans.    The carrier has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a sharp drop in international travel. Lufthansa’s goal is to cut costs equaling 22,000 full-time positions and to trim its fleet by 100 planes to bring down expenses. It also secured as much as 9 billion euros ($10.7 billion) in state aid.   Of the 22,000 excess positions, about half are in Germany and the other half abroad, where it slashed more than 8,000 jobs already. It also signed an agreement with its cabin crew union that will safeguard jobs of 3,000 flight attendants in exchange for cuts to wages and benefits, and struck a stopgap deal with pilots to avoid firings in the cockpit for now. Talks with Ver.di union, which represents ground staff, have collapsed. That has made it less likely that the company will be able to make do without forced redundancies.  {""contentId"":""QFV3IAT1UM0W01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-30/lufthansa-said-to-weigh-more-cuts-to-jobs-costs-nzzams""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QFV3IAT1UM0W01""}   “The way this crisis is developing is alarming, and so is how Lufthansa’s management is treating its employees at this time,” Daniel Flohr, who heads the UFO cabin crew union, told Bloomberg News. “Luckily, cabin crews at Lufthansa’s main line are protected from layoffs, but whoever does not have such protection unfortunately has major worries.”     Read More...
