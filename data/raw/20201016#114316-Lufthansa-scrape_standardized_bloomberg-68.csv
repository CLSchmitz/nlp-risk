Government stakes “should be the absolute exception,” but there are about a dozen current cases where it could happen, Altmaier told the newspaper.    {""contentId"":""QDB1BDDWLU6A01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-07-11/germany-could-take-more-stakes-in-companies-altmaier-tells-faz""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QDB1BDDWLU6A01""}   {""contentId"":""QDB1BDDWLU6A01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-07-11/germany-could-take-more-stakes-in-companies-altmaier-tells-faz""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QDB1BDDWLU6A01""}   The German government last month finalized a package that gave it a 20% stake in German national carrier Deutsche Lufthansa AG. The carrier will cut 20% of its managerial positions in order to repay the debt, it said in a statement last week.    {""contentId"":""QDB1BDDWLU6A01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-07-11/germany-could-take-more-stakes-in-companies-altmaier-tells-faz""},""containerId"":""box-AhtQQHo""}   The government also bought a stake in CureVac AG, which is working on a coronavirus vaccine, in order to protect the company from a foreign takeover. Other deals made in the national interest are also thinkable, Altmaier said in the interview.     Published on ‎11‎ ‎July‎, ‎2020‎ ‎14‎:‎57        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
