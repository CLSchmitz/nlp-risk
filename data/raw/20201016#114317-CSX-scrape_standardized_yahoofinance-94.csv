Among them, Facebook and Microsoft ranked among the top 3 picks and these stocks gained 54% and 51% respectively. Hedge funds' top 3 stock picks returned 41.7% this year and beat the S&P 500 ETFs by 14 percentage points. Investing in index funds guarantees you average returns, not superior returns. We are looking to generate superior returns for our readers.

Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the Russell 2000 ETFs by 40 percentage points since May 2014 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.Story continues[caption id=""attachment_30668"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""478""] Richard Chilton of Chilton Investment Company[/caption]<img alt=""CHILTON INVESTMENT COMPANY"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_4ULGV9bhEvrDlouNUOfVg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTg4NC45MzcyMzg0OTM3MjM4/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/insidermonkey.com/b7a67e2042a9b4f90454c568f95dd254"" class=""caas-img"">CHILTON INVESTMENT COMPANYUnlike the largest US hedge funds that are convinced Dow will soar past 40,000 or the world's most bearish hedge fund that's more convinced than ever that a crash is coming, our long-short investment strategy doesn't rely on bull or bear markets to deliver double digit returns. We only rely on the best performing hedge funds' buy/sell signals.

Aaron Cowen's fund, Suvretta Capital Management, also said goodbye to its stock, about $54.8 million worth.
