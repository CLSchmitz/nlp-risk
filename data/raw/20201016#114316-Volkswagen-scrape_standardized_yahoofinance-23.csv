While the firm’s CEO Musk announced a series of vertical integration improvements and technological advancements, it seems that the “Battery Day” promises did not live up to the hype of investors, as was evident from the share price performance. The fact that the company’s ambitious battery designs won’t make it to production for another couple of years did not go down quite well with shareholders. Shares of the company fell around 9% during the week.Nikola Corporation, often touted as the Tesla of trucking, also had a bad week, with shares tumbling more than 40% over the course of the week. Nikola’s CEO, Trevor Milton stepped down in the wake allegations of securities fraud, only strengthening Hindenburg Research’s claims that the EV maker misled investors. Nikola appears to have been a double whammy of disaster with an enormously stretched valuation from overexcited investors & traders, combined with what seems to be a mounting securities fraud situation that has halted its ability to conduct business.Meanwhile, in a sweeping policy change to combat climate crisis, the governor of California, Gavin Newsom signed an executive order that bans the sale of new internal combustion engine cars effective 2035. With this, California becomes the first American state to enforce such aggressive emission targets, which would further accelerate the auto industry’s roadmap to electric vehicle (EV) transition.(Read the Last Auto Stock Roundup here)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1. Tesla TSLA made some big announcements at its Battery Day event as the company aims to become the world’s largest automaker in the coming years. The red-hot EV maker unveiled plans to manufacture its own tabless batteries, which are expected to boost the range and power of EVs. The firm’s ultimate aim is to achieve “Terawatt-hour” scale battery production with improved battery cell designs and simplified manufacturing processes. In a bid to lower supply chain costs, Tesla plans to build its own cathode plant and a lithium conversion facility in North America. The firm’s CEO Musk revealed that the “Plaid” version of the Model S sedan — boasting jaw-dropping range and performance specifications — is finally available to order, though the deliveries of the same are not expected until late 2021. Musk also promised a $25,000 worth fully autonomous electric car, which is likely to be available in the market in three years.
