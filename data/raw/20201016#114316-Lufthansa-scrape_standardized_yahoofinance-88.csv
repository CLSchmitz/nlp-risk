I'm very pleased to be going back to where my husband is. We've been apart for four months.""About 500 to 1,000 business managers have been offered an accelerated re-entry procedure by the Chinese government, a German business representative told Reuters on Tuesday, with family members bringing the total to around 2,500 people.Even as much of the rest of the world economy has shut down to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which originated in China, factories there have been ramping up production again since the outbreak abated.China is Germany's most important trading partner by far, with around 206 billion euros ($229 bln) worth of goods traded in 2019.($1 = 0.9012 euros) (Reporting by Frank Simon and Andreas Buerger; Writing by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)"
