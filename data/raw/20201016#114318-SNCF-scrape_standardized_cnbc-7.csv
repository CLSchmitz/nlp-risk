The French President, Emmanuel Macron, vowed at the time of his election in 2017 to update the country’s pension system – one of the costliest worldwide. However, Macron’s plans have sparked the biggest public demonstration since he took power in 2017.Speaking after the French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced full details of the reform, Benoit Teste, national secretary of the French trade union Federation Syndicale Unitaire, told CNBC that “workers must amplify the strike, must increase it.”Teste pointed to the concerns over a cut to pensions as the reason why the protests should carry on. Other trade unions, such as the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the trade union for railway workers UNSA ferroviaire, have also appealed for a continuation of the strike.“It is time for a universal pension scheme,” Philippe said Wednesday. The government plans to consolidate the current 42 different pension regimes, which vary according to profession, into one.“We will put an end to the special regimes, gradually,” Philippe said.
