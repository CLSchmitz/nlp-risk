As renewable energy credits have played a significant role in the recent string of quarterly profits from Elon Musk’s EV company, they have been a source of some frustration for Wall Street analysts — who have struggled to get a handle on how much revenue these credits will rack up in any quarter — as well as generating skepticism from investors.But there’s nothing dubious about the renewable energy credit market. In fact, Tesla’s domination of zero-emission vehicle credit trading — where it is estimated to have sold more credits than any other company — is an example of a climate finance mechanism that is working as it was designed to work. Tesla, unlike traditional automakers, risked it all on making and selling EVs. Meanwhile, traditional car companies are required to pay up, by other means, for the choice of delaying their transition to battery electric or fuel cell electric zero-emission vehicles.“The last thing a company wants to do is pay their competitor to eat their own lunch,” said Simon Mui, deputy director of the clean vehicles & fuels group at the Natural Resources Defense Council. But he added that is exactly what car makers like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles — which signed a private deal with Tesla to buy credits in the European market — have had to do. “Automakers are scrambling to catch up and they see that Tesla, like any other automaker who can produce more EV credits than they require, can monetize the credits. They’ve done it from the beginning and it has been a big element in terms of providing a strong tailwind,” Mui said.The NRDC expert compared the market to the renewable portfolio standards implemented by U.S. states which have provided renewable energy companies in sectors like solar and wind power with a market to sell to utilities. “That’s how the renewable energy industry got its start. .... We will see Rivian and Lordstown and all of these other EV start-ups coming to market taking advantage,” Mui said. “Rivian is seeing it and also licking their lips.”The recent numbers related to this trading are large. In Q2 2020, revenue from the renewable energy credit market were $428 million, and that’s revenue that comes at no-cost, unlike the challenges that an auto manufacturer faces in trying to eke out profit margins from the factory operations. It all flows down to the bottom line and the last quarter was the largest ever for these credits at Tesla.
