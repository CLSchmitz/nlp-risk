Amazon was recently seen hauling cargo with self-driving truck technology from start-up Embark.“If I take a look at all the competitors out there, you see they have capabilities in disrupting you at the customer interface,” Hüttel said. “Then you have to carefully choose who is really getting down into the car, where you open up a lot of data to these people, and then you have to carefully choose with whom you are doing business.”Microsoft likes to tout the merits of its cloud technology, but the company is fully aware that taking on AWS, which has a commanding lead in the cloud infrastructure market, isn’t just about offering the best services. Under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft is taking a much different tactic from the days when it was viewed as a potentially risky partner.“We’re not going to turn around and compete with our customers,” said Julia White, corporate vice president at Microsoft, at a Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco last month.
