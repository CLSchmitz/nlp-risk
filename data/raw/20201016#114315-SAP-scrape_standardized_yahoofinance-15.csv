This one-- an international one. SAP has said it's going to sell some of the shares of its Qualtrics survey software unit. Basically, bringing it public. And this is a bit of a reversal for Qualtrics because SAP just bought it a couple of years ago.Oscar Williams-Grut is over there in the UK and going to give us some details on this reversal. Oscar?OSCAR WILLIAMS-GRUT: Well, Julie, you're right. This was the surprise announcement on Sunday from Germany's SAP. That, as you said, just two years after buying Qualtrics for $8 billion, they now plan to do a partial IPO to allow the company to pursue its public dream, which was actually what Qualtrics was planning to do before SAP bought it back in 2018.Now Qualtrics, as you say, it's a survey software business. It's got around 12,000 customers, including lots of Microsoft, Volkswagen, Shell and the NHS here in the UK. SAP CEO Christian Klein said that spinning off the company was, actually, a win-win.Now, Klein came in at the top of SAP just in April. And this appears to be part of his push to slim down the business to its core strategy. He said that a partial IPO would allow Qualtrics to increase its autonomy and explore its own acquisition strategy.SAP will keep a majority shareholding in Qualtrics. They didn't actually disclose what price we could be looking at here, but UBS said they expect the business could fetch up to $11 billion on the public market.This announcement around the partial IPO came alongside some solid second quarter results from SAP. And we saw the stock close up around 3% in Frankfurt. So investors seem to like the news, even though it's come so soon after the acquisition first occurred.- Interesting. Well, I guess that pricing will be key. Oscar, thank you so much. Appreciate it.
