Some other antigen tests must be read using a small, portable device.""You know that companies like Abbott or Roche are bringing these tests to the market and we are definitely looking into this,"" said Bjoern Becker, senior director, product management, ground & digital services for the Lufthansa Group.""You will see us applying them for new products within the next few weeks in October,"" he told reporters during a virtual call. ""That's definitely the next thing to come.""Becker said Lufthansa is considering making the new antigen tests initially available to its first-class and business class passengers, given limited supply.Lufthansa is also looking at ways to expand its network of testing centers to airports in the United States and Canada, given that they are important markets, he said.
