The company’s staff will use an operations platform powered by Google’s cloud tech to come up with suggestions for putting its flight plan back on track.A team of Google software engineers will be onsite with Lufthansa’s IT and operations experts develop and test the firm’s new platform.“By combining Google Cloud’s technology with Lufthansa Group’s operational expertise, we are driving the digitization of our operation even further,” said Detlef Kayser, an executive board member at Lufthansa. “This will enable us to identify possible flight irregularities even earlier and implement countermeasures at an early stage.”Over 145 million passengers flew with the German aviation giant last year, a record number for the company. But it also faced industrial action from cabin crew and other staff, resulting in hundreds of flight cancellations.
