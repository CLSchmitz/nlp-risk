The lawsuit, which also names as defendants  Volkswagen Group of America and Volkswagen Group of America Finance, claims that “false  and misleading statements and omissions” by Volkswagen caused its bonds to trade  at “artificially inflated prices..., only to decline after the  emissions scandal went public,” the law firm said in a statement. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the  Northern District of California, seeks to recover damages for bondholders who  purchased bonds between May 23, 2014, and Sept. 22, 2015, in sales that raised more than  $8 billion for Volkswagen, the law firm said.
