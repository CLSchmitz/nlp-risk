The trial, dubbed Project Tiger, may be replicated in other cities although there isn’t any specific timetable, he said.

Its scores of new autonomous-vehicle developers include the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance-backed WeRide. Some of the nation’s biggest names in tech, including Baidu Inc., also are pushing into the space.  Government Relations  Hefei, in Anhui province, has also been positioning itself as the place for new-age carmakers to be. Chinese EV manufacturer NIO Inc. got a $1 billion investment from the city in April, while VW is seeking a 50% stake in Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Holdings Ltd. and an interest in battery maker Guoxuan High Tech. NIO also has a factory in Hefei, which it operates with Jianghuai.  Jianghuai’s listed unit, JAC Motor, is VW’s smallest partner in China. It has bigger collaborations in the country with SAIC Motor Corp. and China FAW Group Co.  {""contentId"":""QFNM2LDWLU6J01"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-26/vw-to-test-fleet-of-self-driving-cars-in-china-s-newest-ev-hub""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QFNM2LDWLU6J01""}   VW selected Hefei due to its already close relationship with JAC and the city’s commitment to new driver technologies, Soh said.  “We are very close with the Hefei government. They have the desire to do this and we jumped in,” he said. “Imagine if you want to build cars, you’re going to need a lot of suppliers, and that creates employment and so on. If we pick it as our base, we’re starting to do that.”  Along with the test fleet, VW announced five planks to underpin the project: self-driving system, battery-electrified vehicle, fleet operations, mobility platform and services, and content.  — With assistance by Charlie Zhu, and Chunying Zhang   Published on ‎26‎ ‎August‎, ‎2020‎ ‎14‎:‎24        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
