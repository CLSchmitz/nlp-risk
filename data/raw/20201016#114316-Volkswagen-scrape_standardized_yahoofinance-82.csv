But like other areas in the north of the country, it often wastes energy because Germany's networks are limited in how much green power they can transport over long distances.Tesla's Gigafactory 4 in Brandenburg will on its own require 100 megawatts (MW) of power and up to 400 MW if battery cell production is also launched, according to transmission grid operator 50Hertz.Tesla is a long way from building up enough battery assets to deliver frequency regulation at grid scale, say specialists such as utility Axpo. But the company has made several steps to expand its energy activities in recent months.In May, it applied for a UK licence to supply power, according to the Telegraph newspaper. It also uses a platform to bring users of its solar and Powerwall battery system into the electricity market in Australia.""The next and obvious step for Tesla is to get into production, especially of renewable power,"" said consultant Berthold Hannes, who has 30 years of energy advisory experience.""Tesla could use its own locations, for example the roofs of plants or the sites of charging points, and alternatively, or in addition, it could take stakes in solar plants or wind parks,"" he said.Germany pioneered the solar power market, and is in the process of laying a policy framework that will make it easier for decentralised power generation and supply.""Tesla's long-term plan definitely includes tackling the energy industry in a bigger way, though it's questionable whether it invests enough at the moment in that area,"" said a former member of Tesla management, who declined to be named.Thomas Deser, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, said it was unlikely Tesla would enter the German electricity distribution business on its own - ""but it could do so with a competent partner from the energy industry.""
