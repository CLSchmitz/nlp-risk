Whoever wants to return to Germany, we will bring back,"" he told the newspaper.""Be it because they are not allowed to enter the country due to an elevated temperature at their destination, or because they have to be quarantined there, or because of a virus outbreak in the host country - in all these cases there will be a guaranteed return flight.""Lufthansa has pledged a wide-ranging restructuring, from thousands of job cuts to asset sales, as it seeks to repay a 9 billion euro ($10.2 billion) state bailout and navigate deepening losses in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.($1 = 0.8862 euros)(Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by David Goodman)"
