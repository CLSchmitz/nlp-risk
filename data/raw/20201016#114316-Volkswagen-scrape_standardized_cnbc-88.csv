The documents, first reported on by the German  newspaper Bild am Sonntag and since reviewed by The New  York Times, could raise the penalties for Volkswagen based on  laws requiring public disclosure of problems with potential to  affect a company’s stock price. They indicate that top managers  knew sooner than they have acknowledged that they could not bring  tainted vehicles into compliance with air-quality rules, but led  federal and California officials to believe otherwise.  The documents also raise the possibility that Martin Winterkorn,  Volkswagen’s chief executive at the time, knew of possible  emissions cheating by the company sooner than he has said.  According to the documents reviewed by The Times, a confidant of  Mr. Winterkorn wrote to him in May 2014, warning that regulators  might accuse the carmaker of using a so-called defeat device  — software that recognized when the car was being tested for  emissions and activated pollution-control equipment. At other  times, the cars produced up to 35 times the allowed amount of  nitrogen oxide emissions, which are linked to lung ailments and  premature deaths.  It was not until last September, more than a year after the  letter of warning to Mr. Winterkorn, that Volkswagen admitted publicly that 11 million  diesel vehicles, including about 480,000 Volkswagen cars in the  United States, were equipped with defeat devices. The number of  cars in the United States has since risen to include about  100,000 Audi and Porsche cars with diesel engines.
