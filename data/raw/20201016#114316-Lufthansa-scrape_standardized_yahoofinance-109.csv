A meeting of Lufthansa's supervisory board, which was due to discuss the terms on Friday, has been postponed until Monday, the report said.A German government spokeswoman, when asked about the report, said there was no update on the issue. Lufthansa earlier Friday also declined to comment on the status of talks.Lufthansa, seeking to weather the coronavirus pandemic and what is expected to be a protracted travel slump, had said on Thursday it was in advanced talks that would see Germany take a 20% stake.German cabin crew union UFO said on Friday it was ""regrettable"" that negotiations with the government did not appear to involve provisions to preserve jobs.""We would really wish that the government, when it provides money to help Lufthansa, would also help the employees,"" UFO spokesman Nicoley Baublies told Reuters TV.UFO members were prepared to accept hardship but only if jobs could be preserved, he said.($1 = 0.9173 euros)(Reporting by Reuters TV staff and Thomas Seythal; Additional reporting by Tom Kaeckenhoff; Writing by Vera Eckert and Tom Sims; Editing by Alexander Smith and Maria Sheahan)"
