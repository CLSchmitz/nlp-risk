The vote is not expected to take place unless the EU has signed off on the rescue deal.Story continuesThe European Commission has asked Lufthansa to waive landing rights for 6 out of 300 planes in total at Frankfurt and Munich airports, where Lufthansa has a two-thirds market share.The number of planes and corresponding numbers of airport slots can differ as planes on short-haul flights may have 5-6 slots a day compared to just one for planes on long-haul.Lufthansa has 760 aircraft, although Chief Executive Carsten Spohr has said that 100 will remain grounded due to lower demand following the COVID-19 pandemic.NordLB analyst Wolfgang Donie said giving up slots amounting to 3 planes per hub would be manageable.The slots could then be given to rivals, increasing competition, which the EU does not want to be compromised by state bailouts.""State aid rules do allow support for the aviation sector while ensuring that competition and consumers are not at a disadvantage"", a European Commission spokeswoman said, declining to comment on details of the Lufthansa case.Lufthansa called for fair treatment compared with other bailed-out peers and also declined to comment on specifics.($1 = 0.9118 euros)(Additional reporting by Conor Humphries, Laurence Frost, Marine Strauss and Tim Hepher.
