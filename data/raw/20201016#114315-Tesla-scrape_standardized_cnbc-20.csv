But also if you ask me, do I think if Tesla will be worth more than this in five years? I think the answer is yes.”In May, Musk tweeted that Tesla’s stock price was “too high,” which sent it down 12% that day. However, since he made those remarks, shares are up almost 200%.In the wide-ranging interview, Musk also said, “Tesla at this point is not in mortal danger, as it was, say, three years ago.” He added, “The thing that Tesla has been able to achieve is get to volume manufacturing and have sustainable positive free cash flow. From a car company standpoint, that is the real achievement of Tesla.”“Tesla should be measured by how many years we accelerate the advent of sustainable energy,” said Musk. At last week’s “Battery Day,” Musk confirmed Tesla is producing its own battery cells at its Fremont, California, facility and predicted the company would be able to make a $25,000 self-driving car within three years.
