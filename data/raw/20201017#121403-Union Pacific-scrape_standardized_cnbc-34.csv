The union declined to comment.The airline is considering moves such as moving veteran pilots to cheaper contracts as it looks to cut costs, the sources said.The removal of the Dragon brand would mean some of those pilots move to Cathay Pacific and others to HK Express, the sources said, with early retirement offers and layoffs also possible.Dragon has a fleet of 25 Airbus A330 widebodies and 23 A320 family narrowbodies.Cathay has already said it will shift 16 new A321neos for Dragon to HK Express, which operates only narrowbodies and has only one destination on the mainland, Ningbo.
