One owner said he accidentally locked his keys inside the car and couldn’t open it.    Robert Vogt, a Model S owner from Ann Arbor, Michigan, confirmed that his mobile app was down around 11:30 a.m. EDT.    {""contentId"":""QH4BSDDWRGG601"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-23/tesla-suffers-network-outage-disabling-car-owners-mobile-app""},""containerId"":""box-arif9YJ""}   “If you’re unable to unlock your car and drive, that’s a problem,” he said.    Other users tried to bring the issue to the attention of Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk via Twitter.  {""contentId"":""QH4BSDDWRGG601"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-23/tesla-suffers-network-outage-disabling-car-owners-mobile-app""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QH4BSDDWRGG601""}   The company’s stock plunged as much as 9.7% to $383 following news about the outage. It traded at $390.76 as of 12:43 p.m. in New York.  Tesla shares already were sinking Wednesday morning after the company’s highly anticipated Battery Day presentation failed to wow Wall Street. Musk laid out a plan to build a $25,000 electric car in three years and cut battery costs in half, which battery experts hailed.                   Musk: Tesla Plans New $25,000 EV in About Three Years  But the longer-term horizon for the strategy and lack of specific product updates disappointed investors. Some industry observers expressed doubt about Tesla’s ability to manufacture its own battery cells at scale.  {""contentId"":""QH4BSDDWRGG601"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-23/tesla-suffers-network-outage-disabling-car-owners-mobile-app""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QH4BSDDWRGG601""}   Tesla didn’t respond to an inquiry about how many customers were affected by its network outage, what caused it or when it expected full service to resume. The outage was first reported by Electrek.  — With assistance by Dana Hull  (Updates with Battery Day details starting in seventh paragraph)   Published on ‎23‎ ‎September‎, ‎2020‎ ‎18‎:‎08  Updated on  ‎23‎ ‎September‎, ‎2020‎ ‎18‎:‎45        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
