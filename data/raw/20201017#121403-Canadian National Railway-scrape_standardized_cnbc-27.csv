We now forecast 0 percent GDP growth  [U.K.]…Although automatic stabilizers in the government  sector are likely to be allowed to operate naturally, neither  that nor the boon from the exchange rate are expected to offset  the drop in business spending or a moderation in private  consumption growth.”Read MoreGlobal search for returns   Despite this global uncertainty RBC has released its updated list  of “Top 30 Global Ideas” for the second half of the year, which  includes the names of U.S. stocks, as well as some U.K. based  companies like Royal Dutch Shell, Lloyds Banking Group PLC, and  Dixons Car Phone.   Harris says the list is, “A compilation of the top investment  ideas for the year ahead,” and pointed out Aramark, Newell and  DollarTree as his top picks from the list.    Harris said these were three companies that have undergone a  strong transformation through efficiency, growth, and M&A  integration.
