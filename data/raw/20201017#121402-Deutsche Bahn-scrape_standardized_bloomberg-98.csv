Apollo Global Management LLC, Carlyle Group LP and Lone Star Funds are among suitors that made initial offers for the whole business ahead of Thursday’s deadline, according to the people. It could fetch about 3.5 billion euros ($3.9 billion) to 4 billion euros, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.     Rival European transportation firms including Go-Ahead Group Plc, Stagecoach Group Plc and Transdev Group submitted bids for parts of U.K.-based Arriva, the people said. Singapore’s ComfortDelGro Corp., which owns British bus operator Metroline Ltd., also made an offer for some of Arriva’s assets, one of the people said. The sale also attracted preliminary interest from French national train operator SNCF’s Keolis SA unit, according to the people.    {""contentId"":""PVZ7WIDWX2Q101"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2019-08-10/deutsche-bahn-s-arriva-is-said-to-attract-buyout-firms-rivals""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-PVZ7WIDWX2Q101""}   {""contentId"":""PVZ7WIDWX2Q101"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2019-08-10/deutsche-bahn-s-arriva-is-said-to-attract-buyout-firms-rivals""},""containerId"":""box-q3v3doZ""}   Deutsche Bahn announced plans in March to divest Arriva to help pay off debt and is exploring a sale as well as an initial public offering in Amsterdam.
