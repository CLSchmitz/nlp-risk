Net interest income came in slightly below analysts’ forecasts, however.United Airlines – United earned an adjusted $4.21 per share for the second quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $4.09 a share. The airline’s revenue also beat estimates, and revenue per available seat mile rose 2.5%.

The rail operator’s revenue missed estimates, as well.

Revenue was also slightly above Street forecasts, aided by a rise in interest income and in loan volume.Qualcomm – The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to put enforcement of an antitrust ruling against the chip maker on hold. DOJ officials pointed to support for that move from the Energy and Defense Departments, which say it would be impossible to replace Qualcomm’s role in 5G technology.Nu Skin Enterprises – Nu Skin said second-quarter earnings would come in below forecasts, due to reduced revenue in China for the maker of personal care products. Nu Skin also points to negative impact from a falling dollar.DouYu International (DOYU) – DouYu priced its U.S. initial public offering at $11.50 per share, at the low end of the expected range.
