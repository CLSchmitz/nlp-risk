As CNBC previously reported, Tesla has established a prototype manufacturing line for battery cells at their skunkworks lab in Fremont, California, near its U.S. car plant.However, on the day before the event, Musk took pains to downplay the short-term importance of the announcements coming at battery day. On Monday after the close of trading, Musk wrote on Twitter:“Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 & beyond unless we also take action ourselves.”Tesla shares dropped more than 6% after hours on Musk’s tweets, after closing almost 2% higher for the day at $449.39. The company’s stock is up more than 420% for the year.
