A steering committee comprising representatives of the rail company, the French government, the city of Paris and the municipality surrounding the station has been formed “to light a fire” under a revamp plan announced earlier this year, SNCF Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Pepy said last night.    {""contentId"":""NENV9F6VDKHS01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-11-07/france-accelerates-gare-du-nord-refit-after-squalor-jibe""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-NENV9F6VDKHS01""}   {""contentId"":""NENV9F6VDKHS01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-11-07/france-accelerates-gare-du-nord-refit-after-squalor-jibe""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-NENV9F6VDKHS01""}   Efforts to modernize Gare du Nord, labeled a “squalor pit” by John Lewis Partnership Plc Managing Director Andy Street, will go beyond a 48 million euro ($60 million) face-lift announced in April on the occasion of the station’s 150th anniversary, Pepy said, with medium- and long-term plans to be formulated for the development of the surrounding area.    {""contentId"":""NENV9F6VDKHS01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2014-11-07/france-accelerates-gare-du-nord-refit-after-squalor-jibe""},""containerId"":""box-eg4VKaG""}   “I’m French, so for me arriving at Gare du Nord is very normal and has never been a problem, but we understand the concerns of British visitors and we need to address that,” Pepy said in an interview in London following a reception to celebrate Eurostar International Ltd. two decades of operations.    Channel Tunnel express operator Eurostar, which is majority owned by SNCF, as Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais is known, is a high-profile user of Gare du Nord, alongside SNCF’s own TGV services to northern France and Thalys trains to Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. With the neighboring Gare de l’Est hosting expresses to eastern France, Germany, Austria and beyond, the 10th arrondissment in which the terminals are located is often referred to as “l’Entrepot.”  {""contentId"":""NENV9F6VDKHS01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-11-07/france-accelerates-gare-du-nord-refit-after-squalor-jibe""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-NENV9F6VDKHS01""}   While all parties have agreed that a “comprehensive” upgrade program is required at Gare du Nord, it won’t be possible to achieve the same degree of transformation delivered by the 800 million-pound ($1.3 billion) restoration of Eurostar’s London terminus at St. Pancras, Pepy said.  The Paris station attracts 200 million passengers a year to its surface and underground platforms, more than five times the 36 million who use St Pancras, and disruption must be kept to a minimum, he said.
