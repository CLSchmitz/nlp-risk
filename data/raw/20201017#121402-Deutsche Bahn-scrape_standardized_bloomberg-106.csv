Deutsche Bahn AG allocated 57 percent of the 350-million euro ($388 million) bond sale to funds, while banks bought 23 percent, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to discuss the offering. Investors in Germany and Austria bought most of the bonds.    {""contentId"":""OA92JG6JTSEB01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2016-07-13/funds-buy-negative-yield-deutsche-bahn-bonds-as-choices-narrow""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-OA92JG6JTSEB01""}   {""contentId"":""OA92JG6JTSEB01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2016-07-13/funds-buy-negative-yield-deutsche-bahn-bonds-as-choices-narrow""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-OA92JG6JTSEB01""}   Investors in the state-owned German rail operator will effectively pay to lend to the company after its bonds were sold to yield minus 0.006 percent on Tuesday. Yields on more than $10 trillion of sovereign and investment-grade corporate bonds have been driven to zero or below as central bank efforts to boost their economies inflate asset prices.     {""contentId"":""OA92JG6JTSEB01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2016-07-13/funds-buy-negative-yield-deutsche-bahn-bonds-as-choices-narrow""},""containerId"":""box-O41KrXs""}   “It must feel awkward to be exposed to a credit risk and simultaneously lock in a guaranteed loss,” said Hyung-Ja de Zeeuw, an Amsterdam-based senior credit strategist at ABN Amro Bank NV.  “It’s the world upside down: you issue bonds and you get money for free. It’s a result of unconventional policy.”    The average yield investors demand to hold investment-grade debt in euros has fallen to a record 0.8 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  {""contentId"":""OA92JG6JTSEB01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2016-07-13/funds-buy-negative-yield-deutsche-bahn-bonds-as-choices-narrow""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-OA92JG6JTSEB01""}   Buyers are prepared to accept negative-yielding Deutsche Bahn bonds because they view them almost as secure as German sovereign debt. Germany auctioned 10-year bonds with a negative yield for the first time on Wednesday, with bund rates at minus 0.056 percent.  “Investors probably consider this as effectively a higher-yielding, albeit negative, German government bond,” said Duncan Warwick-Champion, the London-based co-head of global credit research at ECM Asset Management, an investment team within Wells Fargo Asset Management, which oversees more than $480 billion.  “The supply of bonds relative to the level of demand from investors is quite limited.”   Published on ‎13‎ ‎July‎, ‎2016‎ ‎15‎:‎08        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
