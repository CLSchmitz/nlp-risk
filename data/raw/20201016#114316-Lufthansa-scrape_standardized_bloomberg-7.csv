Deutsche Lufthansa AG will slim down by 150 jets through the middle of the decade, 50 more than previously planned, the German group said Monday. That could cost the equivalent of 5,000 posts on top of 22,000 that are already going, since the carrier reckons each plane supports about 100 workers.    {""contentId"":""QGT5OHT0G1L901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-21/lufthansa-culls-more-jets-and-jobs-to-weather-travel-depression""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QGT5OHT0G1L901""}   {""contentId"":""QGT5OHT0G1L901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-21/lufthansa-culls-more-jets-and-jobs-to-weather-travel-depression""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QGT5OHT0G1L901""}   Lufthansa said it will record an impairment of 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) this quarter against the value of grounded aircraft.    {""contentId"":""QGT5OHT0G1L901"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-21/lufthansa-culls-more-jets-and-jobs-to-weather-travel-depression""},""containerId"":""box-xNFLDHD""}   The fleet move is the most dramatic yet among European airlines that are rethinking recovery plans as the coronavirus continues to rage across the region. A hoped-for surge in late summer bookings failed to materialize, and with many nations still limiting travel through quarantines and other measures, carriers are beginning to hunker down for a long-term depression in demand.    “The outlook for international air traffic has significantly worsened in recent weeks,” Lufthansa said. “With the summer travel season coming to an end, passenger and booking figures are declining again.”     Crumbling Market  Covid-19 has shattered demand at Europe's top 3 network airlines   Source: Company reports  <style> .chart-js { display: none; } </style> <img src=""https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/imyqUSQZhToI/v0/-1x-1.png"">   Lufthansa shares fell as much as 8.8%, the biggest intraday decline since June 11, and were trading 8% lower at 7.92 euros as of 4 p.m. in Frankfurt. That takes the decline this year to 52%.  {""contentId"":""QGT5OHT0G1L901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-21/lufthansa-culls-more-jets-and-jobs-to-weather-travel-depression""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QGT5OHT0G1L901""}   The company said it will now bring back only 20% to 30% of capacity by the end of the fourth quarter, down from a target of half previously.  In addition to fleet changes already announced, seven Airbus SE A340-600s will be retired, with 10 more, together with eight A380 superjumbos, to be reactivated only in the event of “an unexpectedly rapid market recovery.”  {""contentId"":""QGT5OHT0G1L901"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-21/lufthansa-culls-more-jets-and-jobs-to-weather-travel-depression""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QGT5OHT0G1L901""}   Remaining four-engines jets including fleets of Boeing Co. 747 jumbos and smaller A340-300s aren’t affected.  While global air travel is suffering its worst-ever contraction, Lufthansa is more exposed than many carriers because of a reliance on long-haul and business markets that are still largely grounded by the pandemic. The company is burning through half a billion euros in cash each month, a figure it plans to trim to 400 million euros by winter through “strict cost management.”     Downsizing Looms  Europe's biggest jet fleets are set to shrink   Source: Company reports  NOTE: EasyJet as of March 31. IAG includes 70 aircraft not in service. <style> .chart-js { display: none; } </style> <img src=""https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iPa_lpclISpg/v0/-1x-1.png"">   Lufthansa has started to fire staff in the U.S. and China, cutting its workforce by more than 8,000 through June 30. It has so far shied away from dismissals in Germany, despite estimating that half the original cuts would fall there, saying it wants to reach deals to pare costs while holding on to most workers.  The extension of state furloughs through 2021 has also made it economically less beneficial to offload German staff, partly masking the extent of problems at a carrier that will need to repay a 9 billion-euro state bailout.  Still, Lufthansa said it will reduce administrative office space by 30% in Germany as it conducts a worldwide review, while confirming plans for a 20% cut in management posts be implemented in the first quarter of next year.
