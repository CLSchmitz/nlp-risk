In July, it announced “closer cooperation” on autonomous driving with Ford. A month earlier, in June, Volkswagen terminated its partnership with Aurora, a self-driving start-up which has been backed by Amazon.The last few years have seen a range of tests and developments take place in the autonomous vehicle sector.In September, Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the U.K.-based Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, told CNBC.com via email that the shift to connected and autonomous vehicles represented “the greatest change to how we travel since the invention of the car.”“But safety is the number one priority for the automotive industry and self-driving vehicles are still some way off because of the challenges involved with equipping them to handle all possible driving situations,” Hawes added.
