There were also writedowns on the book value of LSG North America and budget carrier Eurowings, of 100 million and 57 million euros respectively.A slump in fuel hedging contracts was another 950 million euro burden on the bottom line.Shares in the group were up 4.6% in afternoon trade, though analysts expect the national carrier to be removed from Germany's benchmark blue-chip DAX for the first time since the index was launched in 1988.Story continuesLufthansa's April passenger numbers slumped 98% year on year to 241,000, but it laid out plans on Wednesday to increase capacity in September to reach 40% of what it had scheduled before the pandemic.($1 = 0.8917 euros)(Reporting by Ludwig Burger; additional reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; additonal writing by Tom Sims; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and David Goodman)"
