Business confidence rose to 92.6 in August from 90.4 in July, the Ifo Institute said Tuesday. That beat the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. Expectations also improved to 97.5 from 96.7.      #lazy-img-364217308:before{padding-top:56.25%;} “We’re not back to normal yet but things are improving,” Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “The recovery is more or less on track.”                     WATCH: Clemens Fuest, president at IFO Institute, discusses Germany’s economic recovery, the labor market and the European economy.

German 10-year bonds held declines.    While industrial production and retail sales have roared back to life, suggesting the economy is making progress in recovering lost ground, there are some signs that the brisk rebound following the end of lockdowns has started to flag. Purchasing managers are signaling weakening momentum, and profit warnings have arrived thick and fast.  {""contentId"":""QFKCUGDWLU6901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-25/germany-faces-recovery-jitters-after-pandemic-damage-revealed""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QFKCUGDWLU6901""}   Car rental company Sixt scrapped its forecast for this and next year due to conditions in the travel industry. TUI AG, the world’s biggest tour operator, reported a 1.1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) quarterly loss. And German airline Lufthansa, already set to cut 22,000 jobs and sell at least 100 planes, doesn’t expect demand to return to normal before 2024.  The government has softened the blow with unprecedented fiscal support. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet is set to discuss an extension of its generous state wage support program on Tuesday that would come at an extra cost of 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion).  Measures already in place led to a budget deficit of 3.2% in the six months through June, the first shortfall since Europe’s debt crisis in 2013.
