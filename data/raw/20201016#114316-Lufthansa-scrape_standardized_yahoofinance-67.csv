I believe that negotiations could have been more intense,"" Thiele was quoted by FAZ as saying.He declined to say whether he would vote against the deal at Lufthansa's extraordinary general meeting, scheduled for June 25, where investors will be asked to approve the agreement.Thiele said an indirect state participation via lender KfW [KFW.UL] could be an alternative to an outright government stake.""My goal is to create an understanding that there could actually be an alternative - even though this is being denied by management. It is possible to hold talks and clarify where there is leeway.""(This story refiles to remove garble from headline)(Reporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Mark Heinrich)"
