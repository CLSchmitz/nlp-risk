Venezuela’s economy is seen shrinking 8 percent this year, with  hyperinflation averaging 481.5 percent, according to the  International Monetary Fund.   Lufthansa will halt the only remaining flight between Germany and  Caracas from next month, the Financial Times newspaper reported  on Sunday. The carrier said this reflected the country’s  declining economy and the difficulty of repatriating money from  Venezuela due to currency controls.   Amid shortages of basic goods including food, energy and  medications, the overthrow of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro  is viewed as increasingly likely — and the U.S. fears the  consequences, given Venezuela’s proximity and oil wealth. Earlier  this month, U.S. intelligence officials warned on the possibility  of a “palace coup,” led by Maduro’s associates, or a military  uprising, according to media reports.   “Serious and/or widespread social unrest remains the key variable  that could alter the outlook and hasten a government collapse,”  Nicholas Watson, senior vice president at Teneo Intelligence,  said in a report on Thursday.
