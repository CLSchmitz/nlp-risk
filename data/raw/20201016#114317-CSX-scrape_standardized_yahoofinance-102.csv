Price and EPS SurpriseTripAdvisor, Inc. price-eps-surprise | TripAdvisor, Inc. QuoteFactors to Drive GrowthTripAdvisor’s Experiences & Dining segment is expected to have performed well in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has been making efforts to invest in supply and marketing to accelerate E&D products. This is likely to have continued in the third quarter and driven attractive returns from this segment.TripAdvisor’s expanding footprint in the international restaurant reservation space and improved cost-control methods are expected to have driven margins in the quarter to be reported.In addition, expansion of the company’s mobile product portfolio on a constant basis is likely to have driven growth of the Mobile platform in the to-be-reported quarter. Accelerating number of mobile hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor’s website, which bodes well for growing mobile initiatives, is expected to have aided the performance of the hotel segment.However, increasing marketing investments and rising competition may reflect on the company’s results in the quarter to be reported. Also, weakness and ongoing challenges in the Hotels, Media & Platform segment might have affected its top line in the quarter.Story continuesFor the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 69 cents, indicating a decline of 4.17% from the year-ago period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $468.9 million, indicating growth of 2.38% from the year-ago quarter.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for TripAdvisor this time around.
