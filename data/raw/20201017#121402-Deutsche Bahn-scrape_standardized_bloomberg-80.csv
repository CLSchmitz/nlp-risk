Kuehne & Nagel, which arranges the transport of goods on container ships including those owned by A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S and Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.’s APL, has eliminated about 4,000 jobs since October, part of a cost- reduction plan as shipment volumes decline, the CFO said.    {""contentId"":""KHPZ331A74E901"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2009-04-07/kuehne-nagel-says-lower-fees-costs-will-help-weather-slump""},""containerId"":""box-caK0Tlz""}   There’s a “first sign” that the drop in shipping volume at the company’s sea-freight unit is less severe than in the overall market, which may shrink 5 percent to 10 percent this year, van Kesteren said in the interview. Shipping-line rates are still falling on trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic routes, while those for Asia-to-Europe lines have had “small” increases, he said.    “This whole economic crisis will last at least 1 1/2 years, until the middle of next year,” the executive predicted.  {""contentId"":""KHPZ331A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2009-04-07/kuehne-nagel-says-lower-fees-costs-will-help-weather-slump""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-KHPZ331A74E901""}   Checking Credit   Kuehne & Nagel, founded 1890 and controlled by Klaus-Michael Kuehne, is checking smaller customers’ creditworthiness more closely, the executive said. Van Kesteren said he has increased Kuehne’s insurance of goods in transit to 60 percent of about 2.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.9 billion) of receivables from 50 percent a year earlier in response to customer cancellations that have doubled to about 10 a day.  Wares can spend a month at sea on routes between Asia and Europe. The company uses Natixis SA’s Coface credit insurance division and Allianz SE’s Euler Hermes SA unit to cover the risk of a customer’s insolvency. So-called “blue-chip” customers make up the remaining 40 percent of business, the Dutchman said.  {""contentId"":""KHPZ331A74E901"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2009-04-07/kuehne-nagel-says-lower-fees-costs-will-help-weather-slump""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-KHPZ331A74E901""}   Sea-freight, Kuehne’s biggest division, earned 414 million francs before interest and taxes last year. The unit surpassed Deutsche Post AG’s DHL and Deutsche Bahn AG’s DB Schenker in ocean-cargo contracts by 2007 revenue, according to Kuehne.  ‘Aggressive’  After years of growth of international trade and companies outsourcing logistics, Kuehne aims to win market share with “aggressive” sales of its door-to-door services, van Kesteren, 60, said. The freight forwarder plans to increase its sales force by 16 percent to 2,900 this year. The company is also weighing expansion opportunities in the next 18 months, he said.  Kuehne is buying Norway’s J. Martens AS from the fifth generation of owner-managers for about 80 million francs to expand in a segment that has a higher margin than freight-forwarding. Last year, Kuehne acquired oil-and-gas equipment transporter Elite Airfreight Inc. and bought French haulage company Groupe Alloin in January.  “Kuehne & Nagel’s management can be optimistic, because they don’t have their own problems,” Chris Burger, an analyst at Helvea AG in Zurich, said. “With 1 billion francs in cash, they are relatively well-positioned and can respond with assurance as many mid-sized and small competitors will leave the industry.”  Kuehne & Nagel is scheduled to announce first-quarter results April 20. For all of last year, the company earned 198 million francs before interest and taxes from its air-freight forwarding unit, 54 million francs from its contract logistics unit and a 10-million franc loss on overland transportation.
