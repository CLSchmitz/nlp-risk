The goal of that project is to help with Kingdom’s digital goals, the company said. The project will unfold over a period of four years and include the establishment of a public cloud data center in the country, an open platform for local developers, and a center to support Saudi start-ups and other companies. Vision 2030 was formulated by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to overhaul the country’s economy and make it less dependent on oil. The plan includes a greater focus on technology, including a network of data centers. Last month, Saudi Arabia signed memorandums of understanding with U.S. companies including Google, Raytheon and J.P. Morgan Chase. Social media platform Snap is also reportedly in talks to set up shop in the Kingdom. "
