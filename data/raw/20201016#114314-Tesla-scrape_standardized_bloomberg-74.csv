The government plans to decrease an incentive to buy electric cars from 7,000 euros ($8,160) this year, to 6,000 euros next year and 5,000 euros in 2022, according to a budget plan unveiled Monday by Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. The state handout for plug-in hybrid vehicles will be halved to 1,000 euros next year.    {""contentId"":""QHD1F0T0AFB401"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-28/france-maps-out-lower-electric-car-subsidies-in-coming-years""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QHD1F0T0AFB401""}   {""contentId"":""QHD1F0T0AFB401"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-28/france-maps-out-lower-electric-car-subsidies-in-coming-years""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QHD1F0T0AFB401""}     Explore dynamic updates of the earth’s key data points       Open the Data Dash     Close             0   3   2   1   0   9   ,   0   2   1   0   9   8    0   2   1   0   9   8    0   4   3   2   1   0     Soccer pitches of forest lost this hour, most recent data          Meerut, India Most polluted air today, in sensor range         $69.​9B    Renewable power investment worldwide in Q2 2020        0   6   5   4   3   2    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   4   3   2   1   0   .   0   0   9   8   7   6    0   2   1   0   9   8    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   8   7   6   5   4    0   0   9   8   7   6    0   5   4   3   2   1     Parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere       80%   Carbon-free net power in Brazil, most recent data           50,​820    Million metric tons of greenhouse emissions, most recent annual data     +0.​97° C   Sep. 2020 increase in global temperature vs. 1900s average       -38.​64%   Today's arctic ice area vs. historic average       {""contentId"":""QHD1F0T0AFB401"",""position"":""greensponsoredby"",""dimensions"":{""small_desktop"":[[190,31]],""large_desktop"":[[190,31]],""tablet"":[[190,31]],""mobile"":[[190,31]]},""positionIncrement"":2,""targeting"":{""position"":""greensponsoredby2"",""positionIncrement"":2,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-28/france-maps-out-lower-electric-car-subsidies-in-coming-years""},""containerId"":""greensponsoredby-zaauBik""}   A separate incentive for low-income households switching to electric vehicles will be 3,000 euros, lower than the 6,000 euros maximum cash-for-clunkers subsidy that was offered for a couple of months earlier this year.    {""contentId"":""QHD1F0T0AFB401"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-28/france-maps-out-lower-electric-car-subsidies-in-coming-years""},""containerId"":""box-AwSjGSh""}   “We have backed the auto industry while at the same time accelerated the lowering of carbon emissions,” Le Maire said.

The French state’s subsidies particularly affect Renault SA and PSA Group, which rely on the domestic market.  France’s car lobby La Plateforme Automobile criticized the planned drop in incentives, saying they should instead follow the same trajectory as the country’s penalties on high-emissions cars, which are set to rise steeply in the coming years.  “To make the bonus-malus system a true instrument for the environmental transition, the bonus should also progress, otherwise the malus becomes just a disguised new tax,” Marc Mortureux, PFA’s director general, said in a statement.
