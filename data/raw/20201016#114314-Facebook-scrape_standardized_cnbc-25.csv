It also addressed how tech companies have influenced elections, ethnic violence and rates of depression and suicide. Some viewers said they were deleting Facebook and Instagram after watching it.The rebuttal suggests that Facebook may be worried about the documentary’s effects on usage. “The Social Dilemma” appeared in Netflix’s top 10 most popular movies and TV shows list in September and is still listed in its Trending section.In a post published on its site, Facebook addressed several concerns it has with the movie, covering topics such as addiction, users being “the product,” its algorithms, data privacy, polarization, elections and misinformation.
