Keolis, which runs trains in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, accounts for less than 1 percent of Germany’s 8 billion-euro ($10.7 billion) regional-railway market, FT Deutschland reported. Farandou ruled out the French railway division’s departure from Germany as well as any acquisitions, saying he expects Keolis to grow by taking over more train-route franchises, the newspaper said.
