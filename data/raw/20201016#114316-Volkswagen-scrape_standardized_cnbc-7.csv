It is uncertain how severely or for how long this will also affect the Volkswagen Group,” Frank Witter, chief financial officer at Volkswagen, said in a statement Tuesday.“Currently, it is almost impossible to make a reliable forecast. We are making full use of all measures in task force mode to support our employees and their families and to stabilize our business,” he added.Shares of Volkswagen were 0.5% higher during mid-morning deals.
