Drawing the right lines between what is and isn’t acceptable speech isn’t straightforward, but with the current state of the world, I believe this is the right balance.“Zuckerberg has long said Facebook should not be an arbiter of truth over the content on its platform. The company has faced criticism, including an ads boycott earlier this year, over its policies on hate speech and misinformation.Nevertheless, Facebook has taken many measures over the years that suggest it sometimes does act as an arbiter of truth. In its blog post, it said it has taken down 22.5 million pieces of hate speech in the second quarter of 2020 and banned over 250 White supremacist organizations. Most recently, it banned all QAnon groups and ads in support of the conspiracy theory movement.Last week, it also removed a post by President Donald Trump that falsely claimed coronavirus is less deadly than the seasonal flu.
