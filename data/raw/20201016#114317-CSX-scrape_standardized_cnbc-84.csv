In its second oil-train accident this year, CSX said 15 cars on a  train traveling from Chicago to Virginia derailed at 2:30 p.m.  EDT. Photos and video showed high flames and a large plume of  black smoke. Officials said there were no injuries, but 300-350  people were evacuated in a half-mile radius.  City officials instructed motorists and pedestrians to stay away  from downtown, while firefighters battled the blaze. Three  railcars were still on fire as of 4 p.m., CSX said.  The fiery derailment a short distance from office buildings in  the city of 77,000 was sure to bring more calls from  environmentalists and activists for stricter regulations of the  burgeoning business of shipping crude oil by rail.
