The four-bedroom unit spanning the 15th floor of 812 Fifth Ave. was listed for sale Wednesday for $11.5 million. The 3,990-square-foot (371 square meters) apartment, acquired by Rockefeller in 1963, is now owned by his son, Nelson Rockefeller Jr., according to public records.    {""contentId"":""QGT59GT1UM0W01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-17/rockefeller-family-s-manhattan-apartment-listed-at-11-5-million""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QGT59GT1UM0W01""}   {""contentId"":""QGT59GT1UM0W01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-17/rockefeller-family-s-manhattan-apartment-listed-at-11-5-million""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QGT59GT1UM0W01""}   “Own a full floor of American history on Fifth Avenue,” reads the listing by Compass brokers Clayton Orrigo and Kirsten Jordan, touting a 295-square-foot terrace overlooking Central Park.     {""contentId"":""QGT59GT1UM0W01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-17/rockefeller-family-s-manhattan-apartment-listed-at-11-5-million""},""containerId"":""box-Y5r0pWr""}   The apartment comes to the market at a time when luxury sales are struggling amid the global pandemic and a migration of well-heeled New Yorkers out of the city. In August, there was only one signed contract for a Manhattan co-op priced at $10 million or higher, according to a report by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate. At the same time, co-op listings in that price range climbed 42%.    “The bulk of activity right now in the market is below $2 million,” said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel. “Activity is much weaker at the high end of the market. That same apartment today would not get what it would have a year ago.”    #lazy-img-364735262:before{padding-top:67.2710788757933%;} 812 Fifth Ave. Photographer: Good One Agency   Orrigo, the listing agent, said would-be buyers who are staying local are shopping for opportunities they might not have had otherwise.  {""contentId"":""QGT59GT1UM0W01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-17/rockefeller-family-s-manhattan-apartment-listed-at-11-5-million""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QGT59GT1UM0W01""}   “People are saying ‘I want a trophy, I believe in New York in the long run, and I can get it now,’” he said in an interview.    #lazy-img-364735217:before{padding-top:65.01798561151078%;} 812 Fifth Ave. Photographer: Good One Agency   The elder Rockefeller once connected the apartment to a unit he owned at an adjacent building, through a small flight of steps, according to the listing.
