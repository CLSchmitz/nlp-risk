As part of the collaboration, both companies said they would jointly innovate and commercialize products.At the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China, SAP’s Executive Vice President Deepak Krishnamurthy told CNBC: “We believe in the partnership model.”“At the same time, we are also innovating in China for China. We have over 3,000 developers in China. We have a massive China acceleration plan,” said Krishnamurthy, who is responsible for shaping SAP’s global strategy.He said there was an opportunity gap in China, the world’s second largest economy.“There’s a huge opportunity in China. 50% of companies in U.S. and Europe are already looking at smart factory solutions, compared to 25% in China. So we think there’s an opportunity gap,” he said.
