It said it was still in talks with unions representing pilots and ground staff.The company said it would speed up longstanding plans to make its core Lufthansa airline a separate corporate entity, aiming to give the unit a clearer direction, a spokesman said.Lufthansa decided in April to cut 100 aircraft from its fleet of about 760 and not to resume operations of its budget carrier Germanwings.It said on Tuesday it had already phased out 22 aircraft, including six Airbus A380, 11 Airbus A320 and five Boeing 747-400.(Reporting by Emma Thomasson and Ilona Wissenbach; Editing by Michelle Martin and Edmund Blair)
