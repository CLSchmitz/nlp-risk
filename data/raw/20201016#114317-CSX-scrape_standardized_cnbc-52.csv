Hilal launched his activist fund Mantle Ridge after leaving  William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management last year.  Mantle has raised more than $1 billion for a single investment, a  source familiar with the matter told the Journal.  CSX shares leaped 23 percent, their best daily performance since Nov. 3, 1980,  when shares climbed 21.15 percent. Shares hit an all-time high in  morning trade.  Harrison is departing as CEO five months earlier than originally  scheduled. Canadian Pacific’s President and Chief Operating  Officer Keith Creel will take on the role starting January  31.   Additionally, CSX reported earnings on Tuesday, missing profit  estimates by a penny at 49 cents per share, though revenue topped  expectations, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.  The company said it remains optimistic due to improving business  conditions, citing a stronger U.S. dollar and low commodity  prices.   The railroad company’s stock is currently leading the Dow Jones  transportation average, which briefly climbed more than 1  percent Thursday, outperforming the broader markets.A spokesman for CSX said in a statement the company is open to the views of all its shareholders and will “actively evaluate” those of Mantle Ridge.   “Likewise its Board and management  team remain supportive of the Company’s strategic growth  strategy, which has started to deliver sustainable value for  shareholders,” said CSX spokesman Gary Sease.Sease said CSX looks forward to discussing strategies for driving earnings growth and shareholder value with all its shareholders.  Harrison’s communications team said they had nothing to add  beyond a Wednesday press release announcing the CEO changes at  Canadian Pacific.  Mantle Ridge and Canadian Pacific did not  immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment. "
