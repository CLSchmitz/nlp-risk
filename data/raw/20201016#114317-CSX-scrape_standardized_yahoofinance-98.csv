Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.CSX has a market capitalization of US$55b, so it's too big to fly under the radar. We'd expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it's seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about CSX. Check out our latest analysis for CSX <img alt=""NasdaqGS:CSX Ownership Summary, November 19th 2019"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RpysUnkHmdzEdnj5TBJKQQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/58ea0d4cddf535cc1ada019c78ad7f74"" class=""caas-img"">NasdaqGS:CSX Ownership Summary, November 19th 2019What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CSX?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that CSX does have institutional investors; and they hold 74% of the stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see CSX's historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.<img alt=""NasdaqGS:CSX Income Statement, November 19th 2019"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CxcP.nqJfGJc4GTLtM0m9A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/624f82fa9486f941e35ccfa683a70301"" class=""caas-img"">NasdaqGS:CSX Income Statement, November 19th 2019Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. CSX is not owned by hedge funds. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of CSXThe definition of company insiders can be subjective, and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of CSX Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amount to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$54m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over CSX. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.
