This result is remarkable, considering the hugely disruptive diesel scandal in 2015.The 2020 margin target for the Volkswagen brand has now been lifted to sit between 4 and 5 percent.The VW brand, which makes up about half of sales for the 12-brand Volkswagen Group, has also recorded strong sales across 2017.VW’s Brand CEO Herbert Diess said Thursday that a new SUV launch in the U.S., a recovery in Latin America and reduced costs in Europe were helping the firm.“Basically, we are one year ahead in our turnaround program and that gives us confidence,” he said.
