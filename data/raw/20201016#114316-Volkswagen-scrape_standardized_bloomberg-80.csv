You know what we have to do and you could and should advise governments how to regulate and what to promote,” VW CEO Herbert Diess wrote in a LinkedIn post sharing comments from the Microsoft Corp. co-founder.    {""contentId"":""QFPSP5T0AFB601"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-27/vw-ceo-backs-bill-gates-s-proposals-for-greener-transportation""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QFPSP5T0AFB601""}   {""contentId"":""QFPSP5T0AFB601"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-27/vw-ceo-backs-bill-gates-s-proposals-for-greener-transportation""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QFPSP5T0AFB601""}     Explore dynamic updates of the earth’s key data points       Open the Data Dash     Close           {""contentId"":""QFPSP5T0AFB601"",""position"":""greensponsoredby"",""dimensions"":{""small_desktop"":[[190,31]],""large_desktop"":[[190,31]],""tablet"":[[190,31]],""mobile"":[[190,31]]},""positionIncrement"":2,""targeting"":{""position"":""greensponsoredby2"",""positionIncrement"":2,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-27/vw-ceo-backs-bill-gates-s-proposals-for-greener-transportation""},""containerId"":""greensponsoredby-GnkXY7U""}   “As you say, it’s not too complicated -- electric vehicles wherever possible,” Diess wrote in response to a post Gates published Monday, which posited that climate change could be more devastating to the world than the Covid-19 pandemic. The VW CEO endorsed all passenger cars and most delivery vans going electric and for long-haul trucks to run on biofuels.    {""contentId"":""QFPSP5T0AFB601"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-27/vw-ceo-backs-bill-gates-s-proposals-for-greener-transportation""},""containerId"":""box-xa9LohY""}   Switching to carbon-free electricity is critical to fighting climate change effectively, Diess said. “Germany’s target date to exit coal power only by 2038 is for a rich, tech-leading country by far not ambitious enough,” he said, repeating a recent critique.    VW has embarked on the car industry’s biggest push into electric cars in the wake of its 2015 diesel-emissions scandal, investing 33 billion euros ($39 billion) over five years to develop the world’s largest fleet of battery-powered vehicles. By 2025, the company aims to cut the carbon footprint of cars and light-commercial vehicles by 30% compared with 2015. Its goal is to be carbon-neutral by 2050.
