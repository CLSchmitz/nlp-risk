The WSF plans to sell its shareholding by end-2023.Separately, the WSF will make a capital contribution of 5.7 billion euros in the form of a so-called silent stake, which is unlimited in duration and can be terminated by company on a quarterly basis in whole or in part.A part of that silent stake can be swapped into an additional 5% equity stake if Lufthansa does not pay the coupon or Germany moves to protect Lufthansa against a takeover.The coupon on the silent participation starts with 4% and rises to 9.5% by 2027.The stabilization measures are supplemented by a syndicated credit facility of up to 3 billion euros with the participation of German state bank KfW and private banks with a term of three years.(Reporting by Arno Schuetze, editing by Thomas Escritt)"
