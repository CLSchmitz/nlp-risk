Lufthansa declined to comment on the report.The deadline for suitors to submit binding bids for Alitalia is 1700 GMT on Monday. However, on Friday Italy’s government extended to April 30 a deadline to improve the bids which had previously been set for Nov. 5.Rome wants to sell the whole of Alitalia in one package and avoid a split of its aviation and ground service activities.On Friday the government also passed an emergency decree to add a further 300 million euros to the loan of 600 million euros it made to the loss-making carrier in May.It also extended the deadline for the repayment of the loan, which was due in November this year, to Sept. 30, 2018.
