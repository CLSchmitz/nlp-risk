These picked up by 5.4 percentage points to 69% in the third quarter — compared with a 2023 target of 75%.In the third quarter, SAP reported a 10% increase in revenue and a 15% rise in operating profit, after adjusting one-off items and currencies, helping it to achieve an expansion of 1.7% in its operating margins.The company reiterated its forecast for the year and through to 2023. SAP is due to update investors on strategy at a capital markets’ day in New York on Nov. 12.
