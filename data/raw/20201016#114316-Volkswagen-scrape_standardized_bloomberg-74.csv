LLC and Janus Henderson Investors as it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange, according to a statement Thursday. The combined company will be valued at about $3.3 billion, including debt.    {""contentId"":""QG2451T0AFBS01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-03/vw-battery-partner-quantumscape-to-list-after-blank-check-deal""},""containerId"":""box-xKXe1xk""}   The transaction underscores investor interest in emerging electric-vehicle technologies amid forecasts for sharply rising consumer demand. It also marks the latest in a surge of back-door listings onto public exchanges via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which have become a fast-growing alternative to traditional initial public offerings.

The deal means the developer will be fully funded to the start of battery production in the VW venture, which the partners have previously said could be as soon as 2023.  QuantumScape, founded a decade ago by former Stanford University researchers, is a developer of solid-state batteries, an advance on existing lithium-ion cell technology that promises to pack in more energy to extend driving range, lower costs, improve safety and cut recharging times to as little as 15 minutes from several hours.

The Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures is an investor in QuantumScape.  QuantumScape’s technology “represents the most elegant architecture I’ve seen for a lithium-based battery system, and the company has an opportunity to redefine the battery landscape,” J.B. Straubel, the Tesla Inc. co-founder who sits on the developer’s board, said in the statement.  The deal isn’t the first SPAC merger in the electric-vehicle sector. Nikola Corp. went public on the Nasdaq bourse in June through a merger with an entity led by former GM executives called VectoIQ Acquisition Corp.  — With assistance by Crystal Kim  (Adds shares line in fourth paragraph, updates headline)   Published on ‎3‎ ‎September‎, ‎2020‎ ‎12‎:‎30  Updated on  ‎3‎ ‎September‎, ‎2020‎ ‎16‎:‎05        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
