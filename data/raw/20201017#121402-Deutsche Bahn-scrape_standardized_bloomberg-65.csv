Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Minister Heribert Rech, the top law-enforcement official in the state and a member of Merkel’s party, “seems to be looking for a job with Putin in Russia.”    {""contentId"":""L9LRKY0UQVI901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-10-01/merkel-under-fire-after-crackdown-on-stuttgart-21-high-speed-rail-protest""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-L9LRKY0UQVI901""}   {""contentId"":""L9LRKY0UQVI901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-10-01/merkel-under-fire-after-crackdown-on-stuttgart-21-high-speed-rail-protest""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-L9LRKY0UQVI901""}   Weeks of protests against Deutsche Bahn AG’s plan to build a new train station and lay tracks in Stuttgart, the biggest city in Baden-Wuerttemberg, have become a lightning rod for dissatisfaction with Merkel’s Christian Democrats. The CDU, which has ruled the state since 1952, trails the opposition in opinion polls before regional elections on March 27.    {""contentId"":""L9LRKY0UQVI901"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2010-10-01/merkel-under-fire-after-crackdown-on-stuttgart-21-high-speed-rail-protest""},""containerId"":""box-H7vigVC""}   Police in the southwestern city of Stuttgart yesterday used tear gas and water cannon to break up demonstrators trying to stop crews from cutting down trees in a city park to make way for a train station as part of the so-called Stuttgart 21 project. At least 116 people were injured, including three teenagers and a 12-year-old, police said in a statement.    “The government is saddened by images such as those we saw yesterday from Stuttgart,” Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told reporters in Berlin, refusing to comment on local police tactics. “Disputes should be carried out peacefully,” he said. ‘The chancellor sees it that way, too.”  {""contentId"":""L9LRKY0UQVI901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-10-01/merkel-under-fire-after-crackdown-on-stuttgart-21-high-speed-rail-protest""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-L9LRKY0UQVI901""}   Latest Poll   Support for Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc was unchanged at 31 percent, while her FDP coalition partner held on 5 percent, an FG Wahlen poll for ZDF television showed today. The Greens, who also oppose Merkel’s plan to extend Germany’s use of nuclear power, remained at a record 19 percent. With the Greens’ Social Democratic allies on 30 percent, the opposition leads Merkel’s government by 49 percent to 36 percent. The Sept. 28-30 poll of 1,323 voters has a margin of error of as many as 3 percentage points.  Merkel called the Baden-Wuerttemberg vote a referendum on her government in a Sept. 15 speech to parliament. Voters in the state, which is home to Porsche SE and Daimler AG, will show whether they back “the Stuttgart 21 project and many other projects” to modernize Germany, she said.  {""contentId"":""L9LRKY0UQVI901"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2010-10-01/merkel-under-fire-after-crackdown-on-stuttgart-21-high-speed-rail-protest""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-L9LRKY0UQVI901""}   The Stuttgart plan is part of a European rail link “from Paris to Slovakia,” Merkel told the BDI industry group on Sept. 28. “If we don’t carry out this project, we would be viewed as unreliable,” she said.  Television images from the protest showed high-school students and adults tussling with police in riot gear. “When mothers and their children take on the police, they do have to be carried off,” state official Rech said on ZDF television.
