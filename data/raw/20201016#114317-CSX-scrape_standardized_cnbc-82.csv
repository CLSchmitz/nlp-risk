CEO Jamie Dimon said the  bank’s consumer businesses are growing “impressively,” among the  positive factors helping results. The numbers are also  helping lift shares of other banks like Bank of America and  Citigroup.  CSX — The railroad operator matched forecasts with  quarterly profit of 37 cents per share. However, revenue  was below estimates as coal shipments fell 31 percent compared to  a year earlier. CSX had said last month that earnings would  fall significantly as shipment volumes declined.  Chipotle Mexican Grill — CLSA began coverage on the  restaurant chain with an “underperform” rating. The firm  thinks comparable sales numbers will bottom out this summer, it  will take longer for profit margins to bounce back.  Wynn Resorts — The casino operator’s shares were cut  to “hold” from “buy” at Deutsche Bank, after a 40-percent  year-to-date increase and a stock price near the firm’s target. It said the current valuation leaves “little margin for  error” and notes continuing weakness in Macau.  JetBlue — The airline reported a 12.1-percent March  increase in revenue passenger miles versus a year earlier, though  its load factor declined 0.4 percentage points to 86.8 percent.  Harley-Davidson — UBS is predicting the motorcycle  maker will report a nearly 10 percent increase in March retail  sales, significantly better than consensus expectations.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals — The drug maker repeated that  it was on track to file its annual report by April 29, after  major bondholder Centerbridge Partners called a default because  of the drug maker’s failure to file by the original deadline.  McCormick & Co. — McCormick dropped its takeover  bid for British food company Premier Foods. The spice maker  had bid $2.1 billion for Premier, but said it was not willing to  raise that offer.  Wal-Mart — The retail giant expanded its free curbside  grocery pickup service to eight new cities this month, bringing  the total to 30 cities and about 200 stores.  Verizon — Verizon landline workers went on strike this  morning, after saying there has not been much progress in  negotiations for a new contract. The old contract expired  almost eight months ago.  PulteGroup — PulteGroup board member James Grosfeld  has resigned effective immediately, after joining the home  builder’s founder Bill Pulte in calling for Chairman and Chief  Executive Richard Dugas to step down.  Integrated Device Technology — The company issued a  statement following an SEC filing by a group of investors  offering to buy the company for $32 per share. The  chipmaker said it has not had any communication whatsoever with  the investors and is unaware of any information that would  support the idea that the offer is bona fide.  Restoration Hardware — The home products retailer is  buying luxury bath and kitchen seller Waterworks for $117  million."
