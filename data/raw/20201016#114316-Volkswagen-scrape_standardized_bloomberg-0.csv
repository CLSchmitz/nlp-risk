Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg    Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg   Traton SE, the heavy-truck unit owned by Volkswagen AG, is holding last-minute talks with Navistar International Corp. to try and salvage a takeover deal ahead of a Friday deadline, according to people familiar with the matter.    The boards are discussing whether they can reach a compromise on price or extend the deadline for the proposed $3.6 billion deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified because talks are private. The last-ditch negotiations may not lead to any agreement, the people said.    {""contentId"":""QIAFJ9DWLU6G01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/traton-navistar-said-to-hold-last-minute-talks-to-salvage-deal""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QIAFJ9DWLU6G01""}   {""contentId"":""QIAFJ9DWLU6G01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/traton-navistar-said-to-hold-last-minute-talks-to-salvage-deal""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QIAFJ9DWLU6G01""}   A representative for Traton declined to comment.

Navistar shares plunged as much as 21% to $35 after the announcement, matching Traton’s initial offer made in January. The stock rose as much as 16% before the start of regular trading in New York on Friday.  {""contentId"":""QIAFJ9DWLU6G01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/traton-navistar-said-to-hold-last-minute-talks-to-salvage-deal""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QIAFJ9DWLU6G01""}   While U.S.-based Navistar signaled last month it would push for a higher bid and has been seeking an offer closer to $50 a share, Traton has so far stuck to its $43 a-share-offer, the people said.  Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is Navistar’s largest shareholder with a 16.8% stake, followed by VW with a 16.7% holding. Its third-largest shareholder is MHR Fund Management, the hedge fund founded by Mark Rachesky.
