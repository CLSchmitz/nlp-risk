No data is stored centrally, making it impossible to reconstruct an individual's relationships.SOUNDS COMPLICATED - WILL IT WORK?The design of Bluetooth-based apps represents a trade-off between usefulness and privacy. It is not possible, for example, to pinpoint the exact time and place of risk events from the app alone.Protecting privacy, though, is a key selling point for the German app, which is voluntary and will need to be adopted by a large share of the population to be useful.Norway on Monday halted its COVID-19 app after the country's data protection watchdog objected to the app's collection of location data as disproportionate to the task, and called for a Bluetooth-only approach.Germany's app is intended to complement, not replace, existing contact tracing efforts that rely on interviewing people who fall ill with COVID-19 and calling people they have met.Where the app can come in useful is in public settings - such as a train trip or bus ride - where people don't know each other. Its speed is also a plus as COVID-19 can be spread by people who have yet to develop symptoms.WHAT ABOUT FOREIGN TRAVEL?Although the apps are national, the idea is that they should be able to 'talk' to each other. Such interoperability would make it possible to monitor infection risks when people travel between countries.EU member states have already agreed on broad guidelines for interoperability, and are close to backing the creation of a central gateway to handle data traffic between the apps based on the Google-Apple standard, sources say.
