Only four out of 10 high-speed and regional trains are running, national rail company SNCF said on its website. The Intercite trains, which provide a non-high-speed long-distance service, are at a third of their normal level, it said. Eurostar, Thalys and trains heading to Germany are not affected, SNCF said.    {""contentId"":""MOBQ9Z6JTSEW01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2013-06-13/french-transport-disrupted-after-railway-workers-strike""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-MOBQ9Z6JTSEW01""}   {""contentId"":""MOBQ9Z6JTSEW01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2013-06-13/french-transport-disrupted-after-railway-workers-strike""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-MOBQ9Z6JTSEW01""}   While the metro service in Paris was normal, only one out of three trains serving the region around the capital city was running.    {""contentId"":""MOBQ9Z6JTSEW01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2013-06-13/french-transport-disrupted-after-railway-workers-strike""},""containerId"":""box-VDA2GWu""}   Participation is “very strong with one out of two rail employees on strike,” Gilbert Garrel, a CGT union representative, was cited as saying by Agence France-Presse.
