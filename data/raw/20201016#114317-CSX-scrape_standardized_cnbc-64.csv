Like the other major U.S. railroads, CSX has seen coal volumes  plummet since early 2015, driven by utilities switching to  cheaper natural gas amid low energy prices and coal exports  falling because of the strong U.S. dollar.  “The coal dynamic is very negative for the railroads and it will  continue to be very negative for them,” Chris Wetherbee, transportation analyst at Citi, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday, a day after CSX’s earnings statement.“If we look at CSX’s peak-to-trough coal volume, we’re going to be down almost 60 percent this year from 2008, so it’s pretty remarkable how much this volume is down,” he said."
