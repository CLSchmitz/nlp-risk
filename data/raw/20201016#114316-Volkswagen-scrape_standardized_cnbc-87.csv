The company said, specifically, it  will recall 63,000 model year 2013 to 2016 vehicles. Volkswagen  has the option of buying back, modifying or terminating the  leases of the 20,000 model year 2009 to 2012 vehicles. The  emissions modification must be approved by regulators.  Hinrich Woebcken, president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of  America, said in a statement that the agreement is another “important  step forward in our efforts to make things right for our  customers,” calling it a “fair and reasonable resolution.”  Regulators said, however, that the settlement doesn’t address  potential criminal liability. It also doesn’t resolve pending  claims from consumers, individual owners or the Federal Trade  Commission.  As part of the agreement, Volkswagen will also spend $225 million  to fund projects focused on reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. Reuters reported that Cynthia Giles, EPA assistant administrator, estimated that the  costs of buybacks, fixes and diesel offsets were about  $1 billion, including the $225 million going into a trust  fund to offset excess diesel emissions.   Volkswagen will also pay $25 million to the California Air  Resources Board to support the use of zero-emission vehicles in  the state.  The German automaker faced fines after it was caught last year  cheating on American air pollution tests by the  EPA. The scandal has damaged the company’s reputation and  hurt its sales.  The report comes after a series of delays this week to give the  sides more time to negotiate.  Volkswagen previously reached a deal for the other 475,000  polluting vehicles in the scandal, according to The Associated  Press. That deal gives owners of 2-liter diesel cars the option  to have the company buy back their vehicle regardless of  its condition.  U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said German company Robert  Bosch, which produced the software for Volkswagen diesels, has  agreed in principle to settle civil allegations made by U.S.  diesel vehicle owners. The settlement was expected to be worth  more than $300 million, Reuters reported.  — Reuters and AP contributed to this report."
