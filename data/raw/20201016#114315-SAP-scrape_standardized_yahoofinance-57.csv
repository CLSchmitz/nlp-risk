The event had a rocky start on Monday when the site hosting it crashed.The product, called SAP Carbon Footprint Analytics, will generate so-called network effects, getting smarter as more SAP customers adopt it, he said. It can drive product ratings and support audits of a firm's carbon footprint.Saueressig declined to say how much SAP had invested in the product, but said the sum was significant and forecast it would generate an economic return.
