Debut sales by two of Europe’s biggest corporate borrowers, alongside huge European Union issuance plans, will also help further propel the environmental debt market by adding more size and variety in a sector traditionally dominated by banks, utilities and governments.“There is a huge demand for green assets,” said Michael Kobel, a portfolio manager at Union Investment in Germany. “I am happy to see a growing number of issuers.”VW plans to use green funds to help pay for electric-vehicle projects and charging stations, as it seeks to challenge Tesla Inc. and Renault SA. The company aims to introduce about 75 new electric car models by 2029, according to its green-finance framework, which was published in March, just as coronavirus upheavals shuttered bond markets.
