Net income fell to 8.4 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in the six months through June, the Shanghai-based company said in a statement Thursday. Revenue dropped 25% to 274.5 billion yuan. The performance improved in the second quarter, however, with net profit rising 32% from a year earlier to 7.3 billion yuan as the car market started to recover.     {""contentId"":""QFK6HGDWLU6A01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-27/china-s-biggest-carmaker-posts-39-drop-in-first-half-earnings""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QFK6HGDWLU6A01""}   {""contentId"":""QFK6HGDWLU6A01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-27/china-s-biggest-carmaker-posts-39-drop-in-first-half-earnings""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QFK6HGDWLU6A01""}   China’s biggest automaker was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which subdued demand and forced car companies to suspend production.
