Here’s how you can beat it|"  Investors are confronting the potential of an unfamiliar scenario  in 2014: For the first time since the fall of 2011 they likely  won’t have the Federal Reserve backing them up.  If things go according to market expectations, the central bank  within the next couple of months will begin reducing, or  tapering, its $85 billion monthly bond-buying program known  as quantitative easing.  The change could feel imperceptible at first. The Fed probably will only cut incrementally  each month—$7 billion to $10 billion—but by the time  the year ends, QE probably will be in the rearview mirror.  “It is time to stop talking about tapering,” Matthew Hornbach,  Morgan Stanley’s head of U.S. interest-rate strategy, said in a  note to clients. “Instead, we need to start talking about what  level of accommodation the Fed will want to provide to the  economy at its upcoming meetings.”"
