According to the paper, managers from both  companies have for weeks been examining the possibility of Etihad buying a 30-40 percent stake  in Lufthansa through a sale of new shares to the Abu Dhabi state-owned  airline.  In a second step, the two airlines would look at a  full-blown merger, the paper said, adding that the parties would meet shortly to speed  up the talks. Any combination between the two would have an  impact on loss-making Italian airline Alitalia, which is 49 percent-owned by Etihad  and is in the midst of a major restructuring that will likely include job cuts  and grounding of planes. Lufthansa and Etihad declined to comment on what  they described as “speculation”.  Lufthansa shares were up 6 percent on Tuesday,  topping the DAX index of largest German companies. Lufthansa and Etihad last month signed a flight  code-sharing deal after Lufthansa agreed to lease 38 crewed planes from  Air Berlin,which is part-owned by Etihad. Analysts reacted with scepticism to the report,  citing the foreign ownership rules governing international traffic rights, and  questioning what the benefits for Lufthansa would be.  In Europe an airline must by majority-owned by EU  investors in order to maintain its traffic rights under international air service  agreements. Lufthansa is currently almost 69 percent owned by  German investors but 13 percent is in the hands of U.S. investors and a further 9 percent  is owned by other nationalities.      In addition, if Etihad wished to buy more than 30  percent of Lufthansa, it would have to make an offer for the company as a whole according  to German takeover rules.  Etihad’s local rival Qatar Airways has built up a  20 percent stake in British Airways-owner IAG by purchasing shares on the open  market. That has boosted links between Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.  However, Credit Suisse said Lufthansa already had joint ventures with Singapore Airlines, Air China and All Nippon Airways covering the region.  Greater cooperation with Lufthansa could help  Etihad, especially given the growth of Qatar Airways, CAPA-Centre for Aviation senior analyst  Will Horton said. “The rapid growth of Qatar Airways and its future  expansion will make it harder and costlier for Etihad to stay relevant on its own -  everything else aside,” he said in an emailed comment. There have previously been media reports that  Italian shareholders in Alitalia are keen for Lufthansa to invest in the Italian carrier,  along with speculation that Lufthansa could take on more of Air Berlin.  However, Lufthansa executives have repeatedly said in recent weeks that they have  their hands full integrating the Air Berlin planes into its operations as well as  taking over Brussels Airlines.“A Lufthansa/Etihad pseudo-merger, which is what is  being suggested in the press today, presumably encompassing the whole of Alitalia and  Air Berlin, looks rather implausible,” Barclays analysts said in a note.
