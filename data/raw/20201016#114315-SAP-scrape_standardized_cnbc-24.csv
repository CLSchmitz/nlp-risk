The pandemic has forced store closures and widespread furloughs of employees as state after state issued shelter-in-place orders in efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 respiratory illness.Macy’s has called in Lazard bankers who specialize in finding ways to recapitalize financially troubled companies and rework debts, the sources said. Macy’s has also enlisted debt restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis LLP, two of the sources said.Macy’s has asked its advisers to help manage its liabilities and explore options that could include new financing, the sources said, adding that no debt restructuring is imminent.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.
