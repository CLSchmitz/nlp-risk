We remain very optimistic about the future of the company. Tesla no longer faces any difficulty in raising capital at scale from outside sources but should there be serious setbacks in the share price we would welcome the opportunity to once again increase our shareholding.”Tesla shares have surged more than 465% this year through Tuesday’s close, amid broad investor enthusiasm for electric vehicles.Part of Tesla’s share appreciation is also due to the company reporting its fourth straight quarter of profits in its July 22 report, which qualifies it for inclusion in the S&P 500. Tesla also posted better-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries.The company’s 5-for-1 stock split went into effect on Monday, leading to a more than 12% jump in shares even though stock splits are purely cosmetic. Amid Tesla’s record run, the company said Tuesday it plans to raise up to $5 billion through a new stock offering.Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.
