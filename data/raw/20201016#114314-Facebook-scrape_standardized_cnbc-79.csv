The survey asks whether they tested positive for the virus, if they wear masks and practice socially distancing as well as if they’re currently experiencing symptoms. Respondents also share data about their demographics, like their age, as well as their mental health status and preexisting medical conditions.More than 1.5 million people fill out the survey each week. To preserve privacy, Facebook said it doesn’t have direct access to the responses. Carnegie Mellon has now published aggregated data through its COVIDcast API, as well as real-time visualizations. But there’s still a few big questions to be answered: Will this data be truly useful? And can it predict the next outbreak of Covid-19 before it happens? To find out, a group of epidemiologists and infectious disease experts from Carnegie Mellon, the University of Maryland, the Duke Margolis Center for Health Policy and Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit headed up by former CDC director Tom Frieden, have launched a challenge that’s open to any data scientist or researcher. With prize money funded by Facebook, the ultimate goal is to see if the dataset can be used to help find the next Covid-19 surge so public health officials can deploy scarce resources accordingly. “It’s a wealth of information I’ve been stunned isn’t in broader use,” Dr. Farzad Mostashari, the former national coordinator for health information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a phone interview. He also helped create the challenge. “If it’s better understood, this could be a big step forward.”Once submissions are received — the first deadline is Sept. 29 —  a scientific committee of epidemiologists and data scientists will review them. Mostashari, Boston Children’s Hospital’s John Brownstein and Alex Reinhart, an assistant teaching professor in statistics and data science at Carnegie Mellon, are on the committee, along with about a dozen others working on the frontlines of the pandemic.
