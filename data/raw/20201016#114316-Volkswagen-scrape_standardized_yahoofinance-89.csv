So all of those become very interesting things. It’s possible a year or two from now we think that $2,000 a share was still fairly low priced, but who knows,” Hamman told Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.Added Hamman, “It’s shocking [to see Tesla’s stock at $2,000], and it can probably continue to go up. I mean I am surprised by the number. It makes it tough to be a new investor in that stock to think whether or not you will get the returns from a price perspective. But it’s a great company, an amazing company.”Hamman is among the many on Wall Street shocked by the bullish move in Tesla in recent months.This week, Tesla’s stock eclipsed the $2,000 a share mark for the first time. The stock is up an insane 392% year-to-date —130% of that appreciation has come in the past six months as Tesla has shown back-to-back quarters of profitability. That has fueled speculation of Tesla being added to the S&P 500 soon and triggering a fresh wave of buying by fund managers.Market watchers have told Yahoo Finance the latest climb in the stock — which has sent founder Elon Musk to number five on the world’s richest people list with a net worth of $92 billion — is being fueled by optimism ahead of a five-for-one stock split on Aug. 31.<img alt=""For illustrative purposes a woman woks on a computer in front of Tesla website as Tesla experiences an unexpected increase in sales and profits, despite the automobile industry in general going through major difficulties due to global spread of Coronavirus, London, England July 23, 2020.
