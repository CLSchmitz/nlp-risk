No details were given about the airline’s security review.     British Airways had suspended flights to Cairo on Saturday for seven days “as a security precaution” as it reviewed security at the Cairo airport.    An executive of Egypt’s state-owned EgyptAir said earlier this week that British Airways’ decision was “without a logical reason” while Egypt’s aviation minister, Younis Al-Masry, also expressed “displeasure” at the decision.      Egypt’s aviation ministry said on Sunday that British Airways took the move without consulting Egyptian authorities.     Germany’s Deutsche Lufthansa AG  also suspended flights to Cairo on Saturday but resumed them a day later.     Other airlines continued to operate flights to Cairo.
