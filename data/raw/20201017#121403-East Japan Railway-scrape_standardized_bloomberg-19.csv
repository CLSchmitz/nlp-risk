Whitmer’s comments, on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” came three days after 13 men were charged in connection with a plot to storm the state capital building in Lansing, kidnap the governor, overthrow the government and try her for treason.    {""contentId"":""QI1IR2T0AFB801"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-11/michigan-s-whitmer-cites-serious-threats-in-run-up-to-election""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QI1IR2T0AFB801""}   {""contentId"":""QI1IR2T0AFB801"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-11/michigan-s-whitmer-cites-serious-threats-in-run-up-to-election""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QI1IR2T0AFB801""}   “I do believe that there are still serious threats, that groups like this group -- these domestic terrorists -- are finding comfort and support in the rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership, from the White House to our statehouse,” Whitmer said on Sunday. “So I remain concerned about safety and integrity going up to this election.”    {""contentId"":""QI1IR2T0AFB801"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-11/michigan-s-whitmer-cites-serious-threats-in-run-up-to-election""},""containerId"":""box-Uvvwfqz""}   Michigan’s attorney general is preparing to send guidance to local law enforcement officials on how to enforce laws against voter intimidation, as well as the bounds of the state’s open-carry law.

And during the Sept. 29 debate, the president said he was urging his supporters “to go in to the polls and watch very carefully.”  Earlier, in April, when states were in various stages of lockdown from the coronavirus pandemic, Trump tweeted a demand to “liberate” Michigan, along with Virginia and Minnesota -- all run by Democratic governors.     LIBERATE MICHIGAN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2020   “We are prepared to make sure this election goes smoothly,” Whitmer said on Sunday. “We are going to keep people safe as they go to the polls.

Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist—while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2020   Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson was similarly critical Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” The Republican said the kidnapping plot was a law-enforcement issue, and that while there’s no place for that aggression in a civilized society, Whitmer “should not be making politics out of this.”   Published on ‎11‎ ‎October‎, ‎2020‎ ‎19‎:‎40        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
