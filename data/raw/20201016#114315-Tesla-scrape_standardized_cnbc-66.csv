The announcement comes as Oracle tries to finalize a deal in which it will become the U.S. business partner of TikTok-parent ByteDance.Ambarella (AMBA) — Ambarella shares rose more than 1% in the premarket after a Berenberg analyst initiated the semiconductor design company with a “buy” rating and a price target of $67 per share.
