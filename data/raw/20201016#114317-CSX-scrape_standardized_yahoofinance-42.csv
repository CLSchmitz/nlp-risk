The bottom line also decreased 17.3% year over year. Results were hurt by the coronavirus-induced supply-chain disruptions.Due to the uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic, UPS withdrew its previously-issued 2020 projections for revenues and earnings per share. With dividends remaining a top priority for the company, it is suspending share buybacks for the current year. Moreover, capital expenditures for 2020 are expected to be reduced by roughly $1 billion from the previous projection. The earnings miss and the suspension of most 2020 estimates disappointed investors. Consequently, the stock lost value in early trading.However, performance on the top-line front was encouraging despite the coronavirus woes. UPS generated revenues worth $18,035 million in the quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17,420.3 million. Moreover, the top line improved 5.1% on a year-over-year basis.
