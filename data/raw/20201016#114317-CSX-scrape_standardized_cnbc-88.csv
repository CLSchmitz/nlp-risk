Revenue was  also below forecasts, with Tiffany pointing to the negative  effects of a strong dollar and challenging economic conditions in  certain markets.  J.M.  Smucker—The food producer earned an adjusted $1.32 per  share for its latest quarter, 9 cents above estimates, with  revenue also above analyst forecasts. Smucker was helped by a  jump in coffee sales, with lower prices spurring more consumer  demand.  Dollar  General—The discount retailer beat estimates by 1 cent  with quarterly profit of 95 cents per share, though revenue was  slightly below forecasts. Dollar General said both customer  traffic and average purchases grew during the quarter.  Michaels—The  crafts retailer came in 1 cent above estimates with earnings of  17 cents per share for its latest quarter, with revenue slightly  above forecasts as well. Michaels said its profit margins  expanded and comparable store sales rose by 2.9 percent.  CSX—The  railroad operator’s stock was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at  Stifel Nicolaus, which noted an 18 percent drop for the stock  since the company reported earnings in mid-July. Stifel feels CSX  is the best performing eastern-based railroad and that it has  been exhibiting operational improvement.  Tesla—Consumer  Reports gave Tesla’s new P85D version of its Model S a perfect  100 score in testing—calling it “the best-performing car  that Consumer Reports has ever tested.”  St. Jude  Medical—The Financial Times reported that Abbott Labs is  preparing a $25 billion cash and stock bid for St. Jude, and that  it is working with both Citi and JPMorgan Chase on the  transaction.  Guess—The  apparel maker reported quarterly profit of 21 cents per share, 6  cents above estimates. Revenue also came in above forecasts, but  the stock is being pressured by a weaker-than-expected forecast  for the rest of the year. Guess is among the companies hit hard  by the effects of a strong dollar, with a large portion of its  sales taking place overseas.  PVH—PVH earned  an adjusted $1.37 per share for the latest quarter, 8 cents above  estimates. Revenue was slightly above forecasts, and the maker of  the Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, and Van Heusen clothing brands  also raised its full-year outlook.  Williams-Sonoma—The company matched estimates  with quarterly profit of 58 cents per share, with revenue  slightly above Street consensus. However, the housewares retailer  issued a weak third quarter outlook, and said it is still feeling  the effects of this year’s West Coast port disruptions.  Gap—The  apparel retailer will end on-call shifts at its stores and  improve its scheduling policies, in an agreement announced by the  office of New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.  Wal-Mart—Wal-Mart will start its holiday  layaway plan on Friday, two weeks earlier than last year. About  40,000 items will be available under the payment plan, about 20  percent more than a year ago.  American Express,  Bank of  America—The two may be dropped as partners at Fidelity  Investments, according to a Bloomberg report. The report said  Visa and MasterCard are in talks with the brokerage  giant to strike new partnerships.  Seadrill—Seadrill delayed delivery of 10 new  rigs and ships for up to two years, amid what the oilfield  services company calls “challenging market conditions.”  Dish Network,  Sinclair  Broadcasting—The two struck an agreement on a new  retransmission deal that ends a short blackout of Sinclair’s  local TV stations for Dish subscribers.
