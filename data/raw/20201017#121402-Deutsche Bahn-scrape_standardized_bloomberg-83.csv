The company is already working with Facebook Inc., Deutsche Bahn, Lonely Planet and National Geographic and others on map services, Niklas Savander, executive vice president for services, at the Espoo, Finland-based company, said at the Nokia World conference in Stuttgart.     Nokia is expanding map, music and mail services to distinguish its smart phones from competitors such as Apple Inc. The company’s Ovi mapping services are based on data from Chicago-based Navteq, which Nokia bought last year for $8.1 billion. Its biggest competitor in maps is Google Inc., which makes its mapping services available through Web browsers and is supplying vendors such as HTC Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. with the Android smart-phone software.    {""contentId"":""KPDZT80UQVI901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-opens-map-service-to-application-developers-for-ovi-store""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-KPDZT80UQVI901""}   {""contentId"":""KPDZT80UQVI901"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-opens-map-service-to-application-developers-for-ovi-store""},""containerId"":""box-wclMYh5""}   “This is a make-or-break year for Nokia,” said Ben Wood, a London-based analyst at CCS Insight. “On paper, Nokia has a collection of assets that can be blended to deliver things that Apple and Google can’t, but it’s not clear that they will deliver on that vision.”    {""contentId"":""KPDZT80UQVI901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-opens-map-service-to-application-developers-for-ovi-store""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-KPDZT80UQVI901""}   Nokia aims to create the world’s biggest platform for mobile services, Chief Executive Officer Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said yesterday. He announced a partnership with Facebook Inc. to give Nokia phone users the ability to post their locations as status updates on the social networking service. When readers click on the update, Facebook opens an Ovi map with links to other information about the location.  More “social location” collaborations will be announced in coming months, the company said.   Published on ‎3‎ ‎September‎, ‎2009‎ ‎10‎:‎47        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
