As soon as that is done, the management board could give its approval,” said a Lufthansa spokesman.The supervisory board would then be given two days to examine the proposal. Whether the Lufthansa management board would decide on Thursday or Friday would depend on the talks.Rivals such as Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM  and U.S. carriers American Airlines, United Airlines  and Delta Air Lines have also sought state aid.Lufthansa said it expected conditions of the deal to include the waiver of future dividend payments and limits on management pay, adding the package would have to be approved by the European Commission.The plan includes a 3 billion euro loan from the state-backed bank KfW and a convertible bond, which could be exchanged for a further 5% stake plus one share in the event of a public takeover offer by a third party.Lufthansa said it hoped the deal could be concluded promptly to secure its long-term solvency.German media reported late on Wednesday that a deal had been done and Chancellor Angela Merkel said she expects an agreement on a rescue package soon, but did not elaborate.
