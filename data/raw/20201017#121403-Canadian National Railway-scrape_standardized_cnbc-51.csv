Since the market bottom in 2009, America’s billionaires have seen  their fortunes and numbers soar to new records. There are now  around 500 billionaires in America—up from around 360 in  2009, according to Forbes and Wealth-X.  Their combined fortunes have nearly doubled, to more than $2  trillion today from around $1.2 trillion in 2009, according to  Forbes and Wealth-X. Most of that came from stock gains.

So America’s  billionaires gained 7 percent of all of America’s gain in household  wealth from stocks.  This helps explain why the broad economy is still so weak even if  household wealth and stock wealth is at all-time highs. So  who were the biggest gainers?"
