""But we want to win the race to produce the best vaccine and here we have good chances.""The Tuebingen-based startup, valued at $10 billion after floating last month on Nasdaq, is one of a number of firms developing vaccines based on molecules carrying a genetic code called messenger RNA (mRNA) to treat diseases.Hopp said Curevac may also expand its cooperation with Grohmann, a subsidiary of Elon Musk's electric car maker Tesla , in developing so-called RNA printers that would make it possible to decentralise vaccine production.Musk was in Germany this week and visited Curevac, sparking speculation that he may invest in the company. Hopp earlier dismissed this as ""pure fantasy"". (Reporting by Douglas Busvine; editing by Jason Neely)"
