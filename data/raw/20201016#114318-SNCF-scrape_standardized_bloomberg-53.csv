France replied that it had no plans to change the status of SNCF, the newspaper said. The European Commission hasn’t yet decided what to do next, Les Echos said, citing an unidentified person at the commission.    The commission also wants the end of the RATP’s Paris metro monopoly to be brought forward to 2030 from 2039, the newspaper said.
