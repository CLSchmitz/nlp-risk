Lufthansa said late on Sunday more than 200,000 passengers and  two thirds of its scheduled flights - short and mid-length  services, mostly within Europe - would be affected by the strike.  Both the pilots’ and train drivers’ strikes hit at the start of a  week-long, half-term holidays in nearly half of Germany’s 16  federal states.
