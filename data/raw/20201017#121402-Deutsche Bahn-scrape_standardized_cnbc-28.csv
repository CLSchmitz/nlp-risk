Renzi, 39, whose campaign for change has earned him the nickname  “Demolition Man,” chose a combination of maverick insiders and  successful private businesswomen in an attempt to prove Italy was  leaving behind a tradition of dishing out jobs according to  political horse-trading rather than merit.Read More  In a statement late on Monday, the Italian treasury, which holds  core stakes in some large listed companies, proposed veteran  exploration head Claudio Descalzi as chief executive for Eni,  replacing Paolo Scaroni after three terms in office.  For the top job at scandal-hit Finmeccanica, the government put  forward Mauro Moretti, known for turning around previously  loss-making state railways Ferrovie dello Stato.  Francesco Starace, currently at the helm of renewable energy  group Enel Green Power, was the government’s choice as the new  CEO of Italy’s biggest utility group Enel, stepping into the  shoes of long-standing CEO Fulvio Conti."
