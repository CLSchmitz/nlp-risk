The strike has led to the closure of certain schools, cancellation of flights and a downturn in tourism and Christmas retail.Tweet 1Monday starts a make-it-or-break-it week for the French government, according to different French media. The French government is due to unveil the outcome of consultations carried over the last months on Monday and to announce the final details of its pension reform plan on Wednesday.President Emmanuel Macron vowed in 2017 to change France’s pension system, which is one of the most expensive across the world, according to data from the OECD.Macron wants to implement a single, points-based system. This would replace the current 42 different pension plans that vary according to profession and region, which means some workers are currently entitled to a full pension before the minimum retirement age of 62. The proposed system aims to make pensioners contribute the same amount and give them equal rights.
