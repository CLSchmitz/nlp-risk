Moeller AS, the Norwegian importer of Volkswagen cars, including the Audi, Skoda and SEAT brands.""Customers will have access to an even greater selection of electric cars in most segments in 2021,"" it added.At the start of 2020, Harald A. Moeller set a 60% target for electric cars this year.(Reporting by Terje Solsvik, editing by Louise Heavens)"
