It's their first earnings report since becoming a publicly traded company. And the results are pretty eye popping. Emily McCormick joins us now with the details. It looks like the pandemic meant big business, Emily, for Albertsons.EMILY MCCORMICK: Definitely, Alexis. And really a strong business that we saw on the digital side. So we saw those digital sales for Albertsons up 276% during the second quarter. So Albertsons really getting a boost here, both from the fact that consumers were loading up their pantries due to the pandemic, and the fact that they did have a strong digital channel already in place.Now, taking a look at overall revenue, we also saw that up 21% for the quarter ended June 20th. That was slightly below expectations. But again, still growing year over year when we've seen many companies actually report sales declines. We did see adjusted earnings also a beat for Albertsons.Now, here's what the company had to say in its statement this morning. It said, quote, ""Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, the company has experienced significant increases in product demand and overall basket size in stores and in our e-commerce business, as customers responded to the circumstances around COVID-19."" Now, the company said it still remains unable to predict the overall outcome for the full year, due to the pandemic. But it is optimistic, just based on these Q2 results and the trends that it's seen so far.Now, this really was a pretty strong report if we think about the fact that Albertsons had priced its initial public offering below its expected level, had a relatively disappointing debut, and has really just stayed around the flatline since that debut. We did see shares of Albertsons pop just after reporting results. It's been trading a bit choppily since then. Alexis.Story continuesALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: All right, I also want to get to Hasbro. Because toy demand was actually pretty high and continues to be pretty high. But that did not stop revenue from sliding nearly 30% at Hasbro. What's going on there?EMILY MCCORMICK: Well to look at Hasbro's results, the company said it was quote, ""hampered by temporary store closures, product shortages in fast growing categories, and lower retail inventory."" So that's what really contributed to that massive slide in pro-forma revenues. We also saw really quite a bit of weakness, both on the franchise brands and on its partner brand sides. We saw both of those actually fall 35% during the quarter. Franchise brands, of course, including Hasbros largest business segment and includes its own properties, like Transformers, My Little Pony, and Play-Doh. Partner brands, of course, including those Disney toy products. So the fact that production was also not in place for major studios did impact Hasbro as well down the line.Now, the company did suggest that the worst may be over, similar to what we've heard other companies say in their second quarter results. So something to potentially watch as we see the third quarter carry on. Those shares are off about 5% in early trading."
