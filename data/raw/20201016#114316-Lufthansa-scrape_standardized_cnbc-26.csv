The strike is the 14th to hit the airline in its row with the  Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) union and the airline said it has  cancelled 876 of roughly 3,000 flights scheduled for Wednesday,  affecting about 100,000 passengers.  Lufthansa was still seeking to prevent the strike going ahead  late on Tuesday after a Frankfurt labour court earlier rejected  its application for an injunction.  The airline said it would appeal against that decision in  proceedings that could last well into the night.  Otherwise the planned strike will run from midnight and affect  short-haul and long-haul flights departing from German  airports.  Flights by Lufthansa’s other airlines including Germanwings,  Eurowings, Austrian Airlines, SWISS and Brussels Airlines, are  not affected by the pilots’ strike, Lufthansa said.  Austrian and SWISS are checking whether they can use larger  aircraft to increase the number of passengers they can take. For  example, the group plans to use a widebody Boeing 777 on the  Vienna-Frankfurt route, it said.  However, budget airline Eurowings cancelled around 60 flights  on Tuesday due to a strike by some cabin crew in a separate pay  dispute between management and the Verdi labour union.  That walkout started at Duessseldorf and Hamburg airports at 5  am local time (0400 GMT) and is due to last until 8 pm.  Pay talks between Lufthansa and VC broke down this month, and  the pilots have rejected calls by Lufthansa for the dispute to be  taken to a mediator.  The union is calling for an average increase of 3.7 percent in  pay for 5,400 pilots in Germany over a five-year period dating  back to 2012.  However, Lufthansa, which is trying to cut costs to cope with  increased competition from low-cost carriers and leaner Gulf  rivals, has offered a 2.5 percent increase over the six years  until 2019."
