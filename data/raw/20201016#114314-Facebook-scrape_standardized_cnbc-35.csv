Both companies were born in the San Francisco Bay Area and financed by billionaires who made their fortunes from their early involvement in Facebook.Palantir was co-founded in 2003 by venture capitalist and former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel, who parlayed a $500,000 investment in Facebook into a stake in the social network worth about $1 billion. He’s still on the Facebook board, though he has substantially sold all of his stock.Asana’s CEO and co-founder Dustin Moskovitz was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s roommate at Harvard. As a co-founder of Facebook, he held a 7.5% stake prior to the 2012 IPO. He left Facebook in 2008 to start Asana, which sells cloud-based software for tracking group projects.
