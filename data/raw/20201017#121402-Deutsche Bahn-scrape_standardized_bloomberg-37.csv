As many as 50 percent of flights may be grounded during the walkout.    Controllers were due to halt work from 3 p.m. until 10 p.m. today in the protest over pay and contracting out, resuming the action tomorrow between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m., said Matthias Maas, a spokesman for the Gewerkschaft der Flugsicherung union.    {""contentId"":""LZH6DE6S972901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2012-02-16/frankfurt-airport-ground-controllers-extend-strikes-to-two-days""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-LZH6DE6S972901""}   {""contentId"":""LZH6DE6S972901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2012-02-16/frankfurt-airport-ground-controllers-extend-strikes-to-two-days""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-LZH6DE6S972901""}   Fraport AG, which owns the German hub, is seeking to secure at least half of operations during the strike periods, spokesman Juergen Harrer said, estimating that for today as a whole about two-thirds of the scheduled 650 flights should operate.    {""contentId"":""LZH6DE6S972901"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2012-02-16/frankfurt-airport-ground-controllers-extend-strikes-to-two-days""},""containerId"":""box-Kh7pcdM""}   Frankfurt, which ranks after London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle in yearly passenger numbers, is the main base for Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Europe’s second-biggest airline, which has scrapped 50 of 160 flights during today’s walkout.    Travelers are being held “as kind of a hostage” by the controllers’ demands, with the action likely to affect the whole of Europe, Klaus-Peter Siegloch, president of the BDL airline and airport trade association, said in a statement.  Lufthansa Options  Lufthansa passengers can rebook on other flights, apply for a refund or, for travel in Germany, switch to Deutsche Bahn AG trains, spokesman Thomas Jachnow said, adding that it’s too early to estimate how many services will be affected tomorrow.  {""contentId"":""LZH6DE6S972901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2012-02-16/frankfurt-airport-ground-controllers-extend-strikes-to-two-days""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-LZH6DE6S972901""}   Fraport had considered seeking a court injunction in an effort to block the protest, Harrer said before the strike.  The GdF, which has reached deals with Munich and Berlin airports, says it has accepted a recommendation from mediator Ole von Beust for a two-step increase in monthly wages of between 200 euros and 1,600 euros ($260 to $2,082).  {""contentId"":""LZH6DE6S972901"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2012-02-16/frankfurt-airport-ground-controllers-extend-strikes-to-two-days""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-LZH6DE6S972901""}   With Fraport planning to outsource the ground-control function, the GdF also wants it to agree that workers will be transferred to a single company on a single contract, according to Markus Siebers, the union’s wages and rights representative.  Further walkouts are being planned, though not necessarily for this weekend, Siebers said, and the GdF aims to carry on striking “in stages” until it reaches an acceptable settlement.  Fraport says further compromise is required from the union, which represents about 90 percent of the 200 controllers. Its stock traded down 0.5 percent at 44.70 euros as of 3:19 p.m. local time, with Lufthansa 1.5 percent lower at 10.50 euros.
