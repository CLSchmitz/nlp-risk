The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because CSX is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CSX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CSX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.55% heading into earnings season.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise<img alt=""CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tguyJt.eiXVk6M5JXU1Q8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ3MS4wMTEyMzU5NTUwNTYy/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/bec4a49c6fe99d8a1e2530af7f8066b5"" class=""caas-img"">CSX Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCSX Corporation price-eps-surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.
