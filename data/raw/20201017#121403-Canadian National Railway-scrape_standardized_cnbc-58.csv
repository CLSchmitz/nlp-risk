It’s a diverse mix from a cross-section of industries, including Facebook, Amazon, Visa, Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Verizon, Boeing, Bristol-Myers Squibb and ExxonMobil.The S&P 500 was up about a half percent in the past week, but down 0.9 percent Friday, to 2,670, and earnings have so far not provided the expected boost. Strategists say the forward comments just aren’t strong enough, and some companies disappointed in other ways, such as Goldman Sachs, which did not announce a stock buyback.“This was going to be the panacea for the market. This was going to give the market the solid footing to move toward the year’s highs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “I think investors want to see more. Next week, we’ll have a broader swath of earnings from all sectors, and we need to focus on the tech sector.” "
