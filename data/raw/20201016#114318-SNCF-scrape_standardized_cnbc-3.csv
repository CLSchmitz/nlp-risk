Macron knows this and I think trade unions know this,” Antonio Barroso, managing director of Teneo Intelligence, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday.“In isolation, (trade union) actions do not create a considerable risk for Macron. Rather, the main problem would be the coalescence of different protests into a bigger movement against his policies, thus undermining his political capital to pass reforms in other areas such as pensions,” he added.
