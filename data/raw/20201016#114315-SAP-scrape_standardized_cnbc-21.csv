A dual-CEO structure isn’t very common in the corporate world, but McDermott himself was a co-CEO once, and as McDermott reminded reporters during a conference call about the news on Thursday, even SAP’s founders were co-CEOs.“Very few CEOs get to do this on their own terms, where they actually get to participate in the succession plan and hand the baton off in a smooth transfer of power where everyone is happy,” McDermott said.Until Thursday, Klein had been SAP’s chief operating officer, and Morgan was head of the company’s cloud business group. McDermott felt that the two of them were doing well in their roles.SAP didn’t consider outside candidates.“We have a philosophy of grooming our own,” said McDermott, who joined SAP in 2002. “We have a very interesting culture. You have to understand our company. You have to understand the dynamism of the global economy.”McDermott became co-CEO with Jim Hagemann Snabe in 2010 — they replaced Léo Apotheker, who himself was once an SAP co-CEO and previously an executive at the company — and was left as sole CEO when Snabe exited in 2014.“It was always my goal as CEO to hire from within and create a succession plan from beneath me,” McDermott said.
