The energy industry is moving full steam ahead to move crude on  rail cars—a fast growing business, booming along with  increased North American oil production and already responsible  for moving most of the oil out of the Bakken region in North  Dakota.   Canada’s railroads, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   and  larger Canadian National Railway Co both report  expanded oil shipments this year and both expect demand to continue to grow. Canadian Pacific told investors it expects shipments of 85,000 to 90,000 car  loads by the end of the year. A spokesman for Canadian National said the  railroad expects to see 60,000 carloads this year, double last year’s  level.   As the U.S. contemplates the merit of the stalled Keystone  pipeline project, which would take Canadian oil to U.S. Gulf  Coast refineries, rail companies in Canada have been moving  quickly to add capacity in five major projects. By the end of  next year, rail loading capacity could grow enough to handle  700,000 barrels of crude a day from the oil sands region in  western Canada, according to IHS data. Trains currently carry  just 150,000 barrels from there, and more than 450,000 barrels a  day could be riding the rails by the end of next year.  “It’s important because access to the Gulf Coast is really  critical for oil sands producers, but there are other options to  get there. The supply will come on at a similar rate in the  longer-term because we think other pipeline options and/or rail  will get the crude there,” said Jackie Forrest, IHS director  of global oil. "
