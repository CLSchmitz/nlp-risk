The arrangement proved to be short-lived, however, and Morgan - a vocal advocate of the Qualtrics deal - left earlier this year.Klein called the takeover a success on Sunday, highlighting the 40% sales growth achieved by Qualtrics last year as it took advantage of SAP's global sales channels to reach new markets.He added he had agreed with Smith that an IPO would offer the best chances for Qualtrics to grow, explore acquisitions and attract talent.Under the proposed initial public offering, SAP would retain a majority stake in Qualtrics and Smith would be the second-largest shareholder.A final decision on the IPO and its conditions and timing is pending and subject to market conditions, SAP said.SAP said that as it would remain majority shareholder, it would continue to consolidate Qualtrics' results. The transaction is thus not expected to have an impact on SAP's 2020 or longer-term financial targets.SAP publishes second-quarter results on Monday.
