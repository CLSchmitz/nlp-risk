Pritzker’s office. The region’s test positivity rate has jumped more than two percentage points in two weeks, the governor said.

Regeneron Antibody Cocktail Lowers Virus Levels (4:30 p.m. NY)   More from       Paris and London Brace for Curbs; Merkel’s Plea: Virus Update      Europe Cracks Down on Virus With Curbs in London and Paris      Singapore Has Fewer Than 100 Active Coronavirus Cases      Australia’s Virus Hotspot State Records Just One New Case    A Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. antibody cocktail may help treat coronavirus patients outside of the hospital by reducing virus levels and symptoms.  In an early-stage clinical trial of 275 Covid-19 patients, those who received Regeneron’s experimental therapy had lower virus levels in the bloodstream seven days later compared with patients who received a placebo, the company said in a statement.  The results are a sign that experimental antibody treatments could become a powerful part of the arsenal for treating the coronavirus. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease official, has referred to antibody-based medicines that could treat infected patients sooner after they contract the virus as a bridge to a vaccine.  U.S. Cases Rise 0.6% (4 p.m. NY)  Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 0.6% as compared with the same time Monday to 7.17 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.

Finland to Stop Serving Alcohol at Midnight (1:45 p.m. NY)  Finland unveiled new restrictions on restaurants and bars after the resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic began to pick up pace.  Bars and restaurants will have to stop serving alcoholic drinks at midnight starting Oct. 8, Krista Kiuru, minister for family affairs and social services, said on Tuesday.  Finland had about 20 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to Kiuru.

Italy Cases Fall Below Weekly Average (11 a.m. NY)  Italy reported 1,648 new coronavirus cases Tuesday, compared with the previous seven-day average of 1,694, and well below the March 21 peak of 6,557 new infections in a day. There were 24 additional deaths related to Covid-19.  The region of Campania around Naples accounted again for the most new cases. The local governor ordered bars and restaurants to stop serving take-away drinks after 10 p.m. to limit social gatherings. Unlike earlier this year, the Milan region of Lombardy is no longer the epicenter of the virus in the country, with Campania and Lazio, the region around Rome, leading for hospitalized patients and patients in intensive care units.  Warning Signs Flash Ahead of Winter (10:30 a.m. NY)  As the seasons turn and the global death toll from Covid-19 tops 1 million, signs suggest there will be more deaths and serious illness ahead.

He was responding to questions from the media at the end of a speech in Exeter, southwest England.  In the speech, Johnson had called out the “painfully apparent” shortcomings in the U.K. labor market as he pledged a new program of skills training to help people forced out of work because of the pandemic.

That’s the smallest increase in almost a month, though India is still reporting roughly twice as many cases each day as the U.S. and may overtake it as the country with the most in the world. Hospitals in several states are now struggling to secure medical oxygen.  Dutch Cases Continue to Surge (8:26 a.m. NY)   The number of new cases in the Netherlands continued to climb, with 19,326 confirmed in the week ended Sept. 29. That’s up from 13,471 in the previous week, according to numbers released by Dutch health agency RIVM. Hospital admissions due to Covid-19 also rose sharply.
