The reason is as simple as Ford looking to take production methodically and ensure its primary North American consumers get their orders close to on time. “We are focused on delivering it for the North America market right now. It is being built in Wayne, Michigan. So it makes sense to start here in America,” Ford Bronco brand manager Esteban Plaza-Jennings explained on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.But there are probably other reasons behind the move.Ford is also clamping down on costs during the COVID-19 pandemic, so an expensive push with the Bronco overseas is likely in line with that thinking. And finally, Ford is undergoing a CEO transition — from current CEO Jim Hackett to now COO Jim Farley.The Detroit automaker has seen a strong consumer response to the Bronco, which was revealed in July.<img alt=""CHICAGO, IL - JUNE 20:  A sign sits in front of a Ford dealership on June 20, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois.
