New-car registrations rose 1.1% in September, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said Friday. Sales gained in Italy and Germany -- two of the major countries offering incentives to support electric-vehicle purchases -- and offset still-slumping demand in Spain and France.    {""contentId"":""QI8MVJDWLU6801"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/europe-car-sales-rise-1-1-in-surprise-first-gain-of-the-year""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QI8MVJDWLU6801""}   {""contentId"":""QI8MVJDWLU6801"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/europe-car-sales-rise-1-1-in-surprise-first-gain-of-the-year""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QI8MVJDWLU6801""}   Daimler AG, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, reported a rebound in third-quarter earnings late Thursday that topped analysts’ estimates, and expressed optimism about the rest of the year. Truck-maker Volvo Group also posted profit well ahead of analysts’ expectations after cutting costs and benefiting from a post-lockdown recovery in road-haulage.    {""contentId"":""QI8MVJDWLU6801"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/europe-car-sales-rise-1-1-in-surprise-first-gain-of-the-year""},""containerId"":""box-gKyEbNV""}   Daimler shares led a rally that lifted the Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index by as much as 2.6%.

Leaders in the U.K., Germany, Italy and France are struggling to cope with record new Covid-19 cases. Targeted strategies to slow the spread of the disease are being used for now before resorting to the kind of broad national lockdowns that decimated car sales earlier this year.  {""contentId"":""QI8MVJDWLU6801"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/europe-car-sales-rise-1-1-in-surprise-first-gain-of-the-year""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QI8MVJDWLU6801""}   “We’d argue consumers don’t share automakers’ revival hopes,” Michael Dean, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note ahead of the industry’s sales report. He expects annual deliveries to decline at least 20% and sees risk that the drop will be worse because of coronavirus-related restriction measures.

After deliveries cratered in March and April, automakers pared declines the following three months, then suffered a setback in August.

But while total registrations rose 8.4% there, Spain saw a 13% drop despite also offering incentives toward EVs.  {""contentId"":""QI8MVJDWLU6801"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/europe-car-sales-rise-1-1-in-surprise-first-gain-of-the-year""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QI8MVJDWLU6801""}   Western Europe was the worst-performing region this year through August for Volkswagen AG, the top-selling automaker both in the region and globally. Still, with a recovery on solid footing in China, Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess said VW’s monthly orders and deliveries were up as September came to a close. He sees the positive trend continuing into the fourth quarter.  “It needs to be seen how much of the currently strong sales momentum is pent-up demand, how much is cyclical and what’s related to ‘the reincarnation of the car,’” Arndt Ellinghorst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.’s European auto analyst, wrote in an Oct. 1 report. He predicted recovering deliveries, low inventories and strong pricing will drive “remarkable near-term earnings momentum” for BMW AG and Daimler, with VW also benefiting.
