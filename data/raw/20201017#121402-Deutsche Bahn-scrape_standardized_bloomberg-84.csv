The company opened its map services to application developers to build offerings for its Ovi store. It is already working with Facebook Inc., Deutsche Bahn, National Geographic and others on map services, Niklas Savander, executive vice president for services at the Espoo, Finland-based company, said at the Nokia World conference in Stuttgart today.    {""contentId"":""KPE3TP0YHQ0X01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-fights-apple-google-with-mobile-maps-payments-ordering""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-KPE3TP0YHQ0X01""}   {""contentId"":""KPE3TP0YHQ0X01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-fights-apple-google-with-mobile-maps-payments-ordering""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-KPE3TP0YHQ0X01""}   “This is a make-or-break year for Nokia,” said Ben Wood, a London-based analyst at CCS Insight. “On paper, Nokia has a collection of assets that can be blended to deliver things that Apple and Google can’t, but it’s not clear that they will deliver on that vision.”    {""contentId"":""KPE3TP0YHQ0X01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-fights-apple-google-with-mobile-maps-payments-ordering""},""containerId"":""box-QreW0iq""}   Nokia is extending services to more phone models and courting application developers to distinguish its handsets from rivals. It has struggled to maintain market share in smart phones against new entrants such as Apple, which has a large developer base in the U.S. As more and more battles are fought on content, Nokia is defending its share of the $50 billion smart-phone market, the industry’s fastest-growing segment.    Nokia shares climbed 3.6 percent to 9.69 euros at 6:02 p.m. in Helsinki.  Packaged Content  Nokia had 45 percent of the smart-phone market in the second quarter, researcher Gartner Inc. said. That’s down from 62 percent in 2005. Smart-phone sales are estimated to increase 27 percent to 170 million units bringing in revenue of $57 billion this year, it said.  {""contentId"":""KPE3TP0YHQ0X01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-fights-apple-google-with-mobile-maps-payments-ordering""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-KPE3TP0YHQ0X01""}   “The initial phase of the Ovi offering has taken longer than probably Nokia themselves anticipated,” said Carolina Milanesi, a London-based analyst with Gartner.“From now on we’ll see more launches that build an end-to-end development experience rather than ‘here’s maps, here’s music, here’s games.’”   Nokia tools announced this week give developers new ways to package content, Niklas Savander, executive vice president for services, said in an interview. Deutsche Bahn, for example, will “be able to make their presence on smart phones more actionable,” he said. “Companies are seeing tremendous statistics of people hitting their Web sites with mobile browsers and they are thinking how to engage those consumers.”  {""contentId"":""KPE3TP0YHQ0X01"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-fights-apple-google-with-mobile-maps-payments-ordering""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-KPE3TP0YHQ0X01""}   Acquisitions  For Nokia, “it’s a big shift to saying a relatively big part of our future is in the hands of third-party developers, but that’s the only way to go to get the relevancy” for customers, Savander said.  Nokia has bought more than half a dozen small software companies to learn about services markets and acquire technologies. About half of the services unit’s 3,000 employees have joined the company in the last two years, through acquisitions and recruitment, Savander said. The company will continue to make acquisitions to bring in talented teams or software assets, he said.  Nokia needs to succeed in the U.S. because the country is home to most of the world’s biggest content companies and the heart of the Internet industry as well being one of the biggest consumer markets, Savander said.  U.S. Success  Services won’t make a major difference to the company’s success in the U.S. on their own, Savander said. The service offerings must follow the “relatively long” decision process in which carriers select devices, he said.  Nokia announced Nokia Money on Aug. 26, based on an offering from Obopay, a California company in which it owns a minority stake. Customers deposit money with a local merchant and transfer it elsewhere using text messages and voice calls.  {""contentId"":""KPE3TP0YHQ0X01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-fights-apple-google-with-mobile-maps-payments-ordering""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-2-KPE3TP0YHQ0X01""}   The “time has really come” for mobile payments, for which Nokia is developing an “ecosystem,” Nokia Chief Development Officer Mary McDowell said today. She also said Nokia is testing an online ordering system with the textile industry in India, and may roll it out soon.  Nokia’s Ovi mapping services are based on data from Chicago-based Navteq, which Nokia bought last year for $8.1 billion. Its biggest competitor in maps is Google Inc., which makes mapping services available through Web browsers and is supplying vendors such as HTC Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. with the Android smart-phone software.  {""contentId"":""KPE3TP0YHQ0X01"",""position"":""in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article2"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2009-09-03/nokia-fights-apple-google-with-mobile-maps-payments-ordering""},""containerId"":""in-article-2-KPE3TP0YHQ0X01""}   Nokia aims to create the world’s biggest platform for mobile services, Chief Executive Officer Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said yesterday. He announced a partnership with Facebook to give Nokia phone users the ability to post their locations as status updates on the social networking service. When readers click on the update, Facebook opens an Ovi map with links to other information about the location.  Facebook’s social networking system had 65 million mobile users in the last 30 days, making it one of the largest mobile services, Henri Moissinac, Facebook’s head of mobile, said at the conference today.  More “social location” collaborations will be announced in coming months, Nokia said.  (Adds analyst in 7th paragraph, acquisitions in 10th.)
