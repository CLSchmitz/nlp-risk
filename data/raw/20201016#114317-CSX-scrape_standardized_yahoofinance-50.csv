The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total volumes implies a 3.3% decline from the year-ago reported figure.Notably, intermodal volumes had been weak even before the COVID-19 outbreak and the pandemic is likely to have further complicated matters with imports at the major U.S. retail container ports declining rapidly. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for intermodal volumes indicates a 3.1% decline from the year-ago reported figure.Additionally, coal volumes are expected to have been soft in the first quarter due to low domestic coal demand. Further, reduced coal volumes are likely to have hurt coal revenues in the quarter. The consensus mark for coal revenues suggests a 21% dip from the number reported in the first quarter of 2019.However, cost-control measures adopted by CSX courtesy of the precision scheduled railroading model, are expected to reflect on its bottom line. As has been the case over the last few quarters, the company’s operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is expected to have improved in the first quarter owing to cost-containment initiatives.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise <img alt=""CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/t0l_7OhbkhiYxn.6EX8p9w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ3NC42MDY3NDE1NzMwMzM3Mw--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/b45035d538bd18c02a35abf72f4156bc"" class=""caas-img"">CSX Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCSX Corporation price-eps-surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CSX this time around.
