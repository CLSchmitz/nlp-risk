Photographer: Christian Hartmann/AFP/Getty Images     Photographer: Christian Hartmann/AFP/Getty Images   Isolationism has had a bad rap for a long time. At least among the foreign-policy elite — aka The Blob — which isn’t having such a great moment in history either. In any case, Donald Trump’s presidency has brought about a radical rethinking of the idea. “America First” isn’t strictly isolationist, nor were Trump’s harangues against U.S. allies and their leaders. The president wants America to play a strong, nay decisive, role in global affairs, just with limited expenditure in diplomacy, dollars and deaths. (And I heartily agree that the U.S. should avoid entanglements with “Nambia.”)    Along came the coronavirus, and for many Americans, the previously abstract concept of a globalized world became all too tangible. Between populism and a pandemic, isolationism has new life.    {""contentId"":""QHMK0BDWRGGA01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-10-03/u-s-needs-smart-version-of-america-first-against-china-russia""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QHMK0BDWRGGA01""}   {""contentId"":""QHMK0BDWRGGA01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-10-03/u-s-needs-smart-version-of-america-first-against-china-russia""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QHMK0BDWRGGA01""}   That isn’t going away, no matter what happens on Nov. 3. So is there a version of isolationism that makes sense in the 21st century? Charles Kupchan thinks so. Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, has a new book: “Isolationism: A History of America’s Efforts to Shield Itself from the World.” Here is a lightly edited version of a discussion we had this week.    {""contentId"":""QHMK0BDWRGGA01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-10-03/u-s-needs-smart-version-of-america-first-against-china-russia""},""containerId"":""box-aa5Umgm""}   Tobin Harshaw: You started this book in 2012, long before Trump. What tipped you off that isolationism was coming back into vogue?     More from       International Law Can’t Solve the Greco-Turkish Island Problem      The Next China? India Must First Beat Bangladesh      Twitter’s Huntergate Call Was the Right One      A Private Equity Giant Thinks Workers Should Be Owners Too    Charles Kupchan: Back in the 1990s, soon after the end of the Cold War, I began to notice that Americans were paying less attention to international affairs. Media coverage of international news declined sharply. In addition, bipartisan support for international engagement began to erode, especially after the 1994 midterms. Politics no longer stopped at water’s edge.  The attacks of 9/11 reversed these trends, reviving interest in developments abroad and reinstating bipartisanship on foreign policy. But only temporarily. The “forever wars” soon accelerated the public’s inward turn, as did the economic dislocations and inequality fostered by globalization. The stage was set for Trump’s America First approach to foreign policy.  Trump’s isolationist and unilateralist instincts are just that — instincts. His handling of foreign policy lacks coherence, is abrasive, and has left the country weaker and estranged from its allies. But his effort to pull the country back from strategic excess is a response to clear signals from the electorate.  TH: A recent poll, from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, shows increasing divides between Democrats and Republicans on America’s role in the world. (Here is my colleague Hal Brands’s excellent piece on it.) Is that a problem or a healthy diversity of opinion?  CK: The divide in the public is more of a liability than an asset. That’s because we are not seeing a wide range of opinion that cuts across party and region. Instead, we are seeing views on foreign policy split along a partisan divide, which only deepens the polarization of the country and denies statecraft bipartisan support. The conduct of foreign policy used to be relatively insulated from partisan politics. No longer.  TH: You trace the roots of America’s isolationist spirit to the Federalist Papers and George Washington’s Farewell Address. I think critics will say that was a very different world, in which the U.S. was a minor power protected by a vast ocean. Why is it relevant today?  CK: You are right that the Founders counseled against foreign entanglement in part because the nation was young and weak. But in his 1796 Farewell Address, Washington embraced isolationism as a timeless doctrine: “The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible.”   The Founders wanted the nation to change the world only by example rather than going abroad “in search of monsters to destroy,” in the words John Quincy Adams. They saw non-entanglement as contributing to liberty and prosperity at home. The world and America have certainly changed since the founding era. Flanking oceans are less protective than they used to be. The U.S. has over time become the most powerful nation in the world. But Americans nonetheless need to reclaim the enduring wisdom laid down by the Founders that standing apart from trouble abroad often constitutes the best statecraft.  TH: You note that Trump’s America First policy is a throwback to the America First Committee before WWII. Can you briefly describe the committee and whether, before Pearl Harbor, it was having much success?  CK: The America First Committee formed in 1940 to resist U.S. involvement in World War II. It opened some 450 chapters and subchapters around the country. Its roughly 800,000 members included prominent politicians as well as public figures such as Charles Lindbergh, Frank Lloyd Wright and Henry Ford. It wielded considerable influence in a country in which isolationist sentiment was already running strong. In 1941, prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, some 80% of the public wanted the country to stay out of World War II.  TH: The isolationism of the 1930s and 1940s has had a very bad reputation. Is that getting a more nuanced look today?  CK: The misguided isolationism of the 1930s does not deserve a fresh look. It needs to be distinguished from what came before. During the 19th century, isolationism helped the U.S. rise in unmolested fashion. America ascended while carefully avoiding the entanglement in alliances or great-power rivalry that could have compromised its security, its prosperity and its liberty at home and abroad.  But if 19th century was isolationism’s finest hour, the interwar era was surely its darkest and most deluded. The U.S. engaged in a misguided search for strategic immunity as fascism and militarism swept across Europe and Asia. America’s passivity during the 1930s helped clear the way for World War II, which took the lives of some 80 million people, including more than 400,000 Americans.   TH: You wrote a piece for the Atlantic recently called “Isolationism Is Not a Dirty Word.” But it has been an ugly one: Isolationism has often gone hand in hand with xenophobia and racism. Is there way to delink there?  CK: You are correct that isolationist sentiment has regularly intermixed with racism and xenophobia. During the 19th century, Americans regularly debated whether to annex territories beyond North America, including Haiti, Cuba, Santo Domingo, the Virgin Islands and Hawaii. But such expansion was blocked in no small part by the union’s unwillingness to incorporate more nonwhites into the body politic.  The isolationist impulse regularly intermingled with anti-immigrant sentiment, especially during the interwar era. Congress passed legislation in 1924 that not only excluded Asians but also decreased by 90% the inflow of Jews and Catholics from Eastern and Southern Europe. The America First Committee had prominent members who were blatantly anti-Semitic. Trump often melds his isolationist inclinations with nativism.  But strategic retrenchment as a doctrine has no racist content. It is about stepping back from overreach. The U.S. can and should remain a bastion of pluralism even as it trims its foreign commitments. Indeed, Americans must strive to be a model of unity amid diversity as sectarian passions cleave the Middle East, Hindu nationalism unsettles India, the Chinese “re-educate” Uighurs, and discord over immigration and multiculturalism test European solidarity.   TH: When Covid first hit, there were dire warnings of the “end of globalization.” That hasn’t happened, but has the pandemic given impetus to the idea of the U.S. distancing itself from the world? Has it shown wisdom in that approach?  CK: Dire warnings of the “end of globalization” were naive. The global economy is irreversibly interdependent. There may be some realignment of supply chains, but real decoupling between China and the U.S. is a remote prospect. The pandemic has devastated international travel and closed America’s borders with its neighbors.  But these are temporary dislocations. Moreover, the pandemic underscores the need for more international cooperation to face down global challenges.  {""contentId"":""QHMK0BDWRGGA01"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-10-03/u-s-needs-smart-version-of-america-first-against-china-russia""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QHMK0BDWRGGA01""}   {""contentId"":""QHMK0BDWRGGA01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-10-03/u-s-needs-smart-version-of-america-first-against-china-russia""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QHMK0BDWRGGA01""}   Nonetheless, the pandemic will prompt the U.S. to pull back from international engagement. With the country passing through an economic crisis on a scale not seen since the 1930s, the winner of the presidential election will need to focus like a laser on domestic renewal — taming the pandemic, bringing the economy back to life, advancing public health, and addressing the future of work, wage stagnation and inequality. Simply put, Americans want investment in Arkansas, not Afghanistan. Moreover, the country has a great of work to do at home to repair its dysfunctional democratic institutions.  TH: Trump often says he wants America’s allies to do more heavy lifting. But isn’t the way to accomplish that through more low-cost engagement, diplomacy and the like? Or do threats and insults work?  CK: Brow-beating may work in getting allies to spend more, but it’s not worth it. That’s because insults and abuse alienate our allies and weaken cohesion. America’s reputation abroad has plunged during the Trump presidency, eroding the partnerships that we need to address global challenges. Moreover, as the U.S. steps back from its role as global policeman, it will want like-minded countries to help fill the gap; the necessary partnerships become stronger only through respectful diplomacy and teamwork.  TH: I think for many in the U.S. the main argument against pulling back from the world can be summed up in one word: China. And about the only thing Trump and Joe Biden agree on is getting tough with Beijing. How can an America leaning toward isolationism deal with that challenge?  CK: I don’t foresee or argue for a strategic pullback from Asia. A judicious retrenchment should entail shedding U.S. entanglements in the periphery, not in the strategic heartlands of Europe and Asia. America’s main misstep since the end of the Cold War has been unnecessary embroilment in wars of choice in the Middle East.  In contrast, pulling back from Eurasia in the face of Russian and Chinese threats constitutes precisely the kind of rash overcorrection that the U.S. must avoid. The nation learned that the hard way when it failed to confront Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.   Whether Trump or Biden wins, relations between the U.S. and China will be tense. Conflicts of interest abound — over security in the western Pacific, trade, human rights and Hong Kong, among other issues. But if Biden is the next president, I would expect to see a more coherent policy toward China that entails sustained engagement and dialogue. That dialogue may or may not lead to lower tensions and more cooperation. But the stakes are sufficiently high that they warrant smart and nimble statecraft, not foreign policy by tweet.  TH: In the end, you argue for a compromise between isolationism and interventionism. In addition to China, can you describe briefly (as briefly as possible anyway) how would that play out in terms of the greatest risks the U.S. faces today — Russia, the Middle East, terrorism, etc.?  CK: The U.S. needs to step back, without stepping away. It needs to undertake a judicious retrenchment, not a perilous retreat. It needs to rebuild bipartisan support for a brand of U.S. statecraft that does less, but still does enough.  That will mean ending errant land wars in the strategic periphery. Strategic objectives in the Middle East — protecting the flow of oil, containing Iran, fighting violent extremism, standing by Israel’s security — can be done through diplomacy and offshore military platforms.  Even while the U.S. maintains its military presence in Europe and East Asia, it needs to broaden its toolbox and allocate more time and resources to nontraditional security threats, including climate change and cyberattacks. And notably, the U.S. cannot afford to go it alone in a globalized world. Teamwork, coalition-building and joint initiative must remain staples of U.S. statecraft     This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.
