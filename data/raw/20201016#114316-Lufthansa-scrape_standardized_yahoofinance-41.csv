Good for the company, for the workers at Lufthansa and for Germany,"" he said, adding the company had been fundamentally healthy but was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Now it can concentrate on recovering.""The investment must not burden taxpayers, said Scholz, adding the state's involvement was only for a limited time and when the carrier was fit again, it would sell the stake, hopefully at a small profit.
