Bank of  America—UBS downgraded the stock to  “neutral” from “buy,” on worries about “missteps” in the  company’s capital planning process. Separately, B of A said  director and former chairman Chad Holliday, director Clayton  Rose, and chief accounting officer Neil Cotty will be leaving the  bank in the coming weeks.  T-Mobile US—The  mobile provider cut its margin target to 32 to 34 percent for  2017, down from 34 to 36 percent. CEO John Legere told an  investor conference the cut was due to the rapid growth in the  company’s customer base.  Legere also said it “makes some  sense” for T-Mobile to team up with satellite TV provider  Dish Network.  CSX—The railroad  operator’s stock was upgraded to “outperform” from “market  perform” at BMO, which cites a significant cost reduction  opportunity and an improving pricing environment, among other  factors.  Potbelly—Chief  Financial Officer Charles Talbot will resign to take a position  with another company outside the restaurant industry. Talbot will  remain until March 27, while a search for his replacement takes  place.  Monster Beverage—The energy  drink maker earned 72 cents per share for its latest quarter, 13  cents above estimates, while sales were also well above  estimates. The company’s results were helped by a jump in  overseas sales.  J.C. Penney—The  retailer posted a breakeven quarter on an adjusted basis, falling  short of the 11 cent consensus analyst estimate. Revenue was  above forecasts, and comparable store sales did rise a better  than expected 4.4 percent.  Gap—The parent of  Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic earned 75 cents per share for  its latest quarter, a penny above estimates, with revenue in  line. Gap issued a conservative forecast for 2015, pointing to  West Coast port disruptions and a stronger dollar.  Herbalife—The nutritional product  maker beat estimates by 19 cents with adjusted  quarterly profit of $1.41 per share. However, revenue fell short  of analyst forecasts, as  does Herbalife’s first quarter and  full-year sales guidance. Herbalife, like others, said it would  be negatively impacted by the effects of a stronger  dollar.  Ross  Stores—The discount  retailer reported quarterly profit of $1.20 per  share, 9 cents above estimates, with revenue also beating  forecasts. Ross also  increased its quarterly dividend to  23½ cents per share from 20  cents, and will buy back $1.4 billion in stock.  Splunk—The  provider of data analytics software earned an  adjusted 9 cents per share for its latest quarter, 5 cents above  estimates, and revenue was also above Street  projections. Splunk also  issued an upbeat full-year revenue forecast.  Weight  Watchers—The weight loss  company matched estimates with adjusted  quarterly profit of 7 cents per share. However, revenue was shy  of forecasts, and Weight Watchers′  2015 earnings guidance is substantially below estimates as it  loses members, and people turn to free apps and fitness tracking  devices.  Urban  Outfitters—The apparel retailer announced a  $20 million share buyback.  JDS Uniphase—JDS  announced the names of the two new companies that will result  from its planned split, expected to be completed by September. Lumentum will focus on optical communications and  commercial lasers, while Viavi will specialize in network  enablement and optical security.  Apple—The company was  sued by Sweden’s Ericsson for  patent infringement, in connection with the use of various mobile  networking standards.  TiVo—The maker of digital video recorders is  among the companies that bought assets from bankrupt TV-streaming  company Aereo, with patent company RPX and Alliance Technology Solutions also  participating. The sale brought in less than $2 million,  compared to the $4 million Aereo was hoping to raise."
