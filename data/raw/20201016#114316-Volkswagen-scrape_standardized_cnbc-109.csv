Fleming added that even though the  comparable gas-powered models haven’t seen as steep of a decline  in resale value, they could take a bigger hit if the negative  response toward Volkswagen goes beyond just the diesel  market.   According to Fleming, the price difference between the diesel  and gas-powered Volkswagen models has fallen from around $2,700  to just $1,300.  Despite the decrease in value of used cars, Volkswagen revealed  Thursday that its U.S. sales rose 0.6 percent in September, versus an  expected decline of 7.3 percent.
