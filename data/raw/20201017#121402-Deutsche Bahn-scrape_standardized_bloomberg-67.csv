A decision to curb business with Goldman Sachs would be considered if the Securities and Exchange Commission allegations are proven, said the German official, who declined to be named because the matter hasn’t been considered by Merkel’s Cabinet.    {""contentId"":""L183Y60UQVI901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-04-21/merkel-said-to-avoid-working-with-goldman-sachs-pending-sec-suit-outcome""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-L183Y60UQVI901""}   {""contentId"":""L183Y60UQVI901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-04-21/merkel-said-to-avoid-working-with-goldman-sachs-pending-sec-suit-outcome""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-L183Y60UQVI901""}   The remarks come as politicians in Europe squabble over doing business with Goldman Sachs, underscoring the limits of rhetoric. In Germany, Goldman Sachs remains a primary dealer of bunds and underwriter for the KfW state development bank, spokesmen for the institutions say. U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling rejected calls to bar the New York- based investment bank from government work.     {""contentId"":""L183Y60UQVI901"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2010-04-21/merkel-said-to-avoid-working-with-goldman-sachs-pending-sec-suit-outcome""},""containerId"":""box-mqKmuKw""}   Germany’s BaFin regulator is in contact with the SEC to seek further details of Goldman Sachs’ involvement with IKB Deutschland Industriebank AG, Finance Ministry spokeswoman Jeanette Schwamberger told reporters April 19. IKB was Germany’s first victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 and was bailed out with almost 10 billion euros ($13.5 billion) by KfW Group to shore up the German banking system.

Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing and said it would fight the suit. Monika Schaller, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in Frankfurt, declined to comment when contacted by phone today.  Until the German probe’s completion, Goldman Sachs will remain an “important member” of a 30-member bidding group for federal government bonds, Finance Agency spokesman Joerg Mueller said by phone. BaFin “would have to present an opinion that Goldman violated financial market laws” before action could be taken.  {""contentId"":""L183Y60UQVI901"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2010-04-21/merkel-said-to-avoid-working-with-goldman-sachs-pending-sec-suit-outcome""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-L183Y60UQVI901""}   KfW works with all big banks that play a role in the placement of corporate bonds, including Goldman Sachs, spokesman Wolfram Schweickhardt said.  The German government turned to Goldman Sachs for advice when it planned to privatize state-owned companies Deutsche Telekom AG and Deutsche Bahn AG. The initial public offering of rail company Deutsche Bahn has been postponed.  Berlin’s regional government wants to keep Goldman Sachs at arm’s length, said the city-state’s local finance minister, Ulrich Nussbaum.  “If at all possible, one should avoid doing business with these people,” Nussbaum said via his spokesman, Daniel Abbou.
