France, the power company’s parent, will buy as much as 960 million euros of the convertibles, based on an EDF statement. The utility is also set to price 2.1 billion euros of hybrid bonds, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak about it.    {""contentId"":""QGCIUFBXZE9S01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-08/edf-to-sell-record-2-8-billion-of-green-convertible-bonds-keu3vks4""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QGCIUFBXZE9S01""}   {""contentId"":""QGCIUFBXZE9S01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-08/edf-to-sell-record-2-8-billion-of-green-convertible-bonds-keu3vks4""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QGCIUFBXZE9S01""}     Explore dynamic updates of the earth’s key data points       Open the Data Dash     Close          42%   Carbon-free net power in the U.S., most recent data          0   6   5   4   3   2    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   4   3   2   1   0   .   0   0   9   8   7   6    0   2   1   0   9   8    0   4   3   2   1   0    0   7   6   5   4   3    0   8   7   6   5   4    0   2   1   0   9   8     Parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere       -38.​85%   Today's arctic ice area vs. historic average          Meerut, India Most polluted air today, in sensor range         50,​820    Million metric tons of greenhouse emissions, most recent annual data     +0.​97° C   Sep. 2020 increase in global temperature vs. 1900s average           $69.​9B    Renewable power investment worldwide in Q2 2020        0   4   3   2   1   0   ,   0   7   6   5   4   3    0   1   0   9   8   7    0   7   6   5   4   3     Soccer pitches of forest lost this hour, most recent data       {""contentId"":""QGCIUFBXZE9S01"",""position"":""greensponsoredby"",""dimensions"":{""small_desktop"":[[190,31]],""large_desktop"":[[190,31]],""tablet"":[[190,31]],""mobile"":[[190,31]]},""positionIncrement"":2,""targeting"":{""position"":""greensponsoredby2"",""positionIncrement"":2,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-08/edf-to-sell-record-2-8-billion-of-green-convertible-bonds-keu3vks4""},""containerId"":""greensponsoredby-56TgswU""}   The convertible sale surpasses all such outstanding green deals combined, based on data compiled Bloomberg, and marks another step in the spread of socially responsible investing across global financial markets.

Still, EDF may benefit from lower interest costs and incremental earnings from new projects, Jefferies Financial Group Inc. said in a note.

It rated the hybrids at BB-, three steps below investment grade.  Representatives at EDF didn’t immediately respond to emails and calls seeking comment.  The power company is the second-largest hybrid issuer in the world, after Volkswagen AG, with more than $14 billion of subordinated notes outstanding, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies are incentivized to issue hybrids as they are partly recognized as equity by rating companies, improving their creditworthiness.  — With assistance by Swetha Gopinath   Published on ‎8‎ ‎September‎, ‎2020‎ ‎15‎:‎55        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
