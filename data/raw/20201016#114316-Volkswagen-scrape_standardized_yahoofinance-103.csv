The best part is it’s creating monumental investing opportunities worth billions of dollars. These opportunities include autonomous vehicle stocks.Self-driving vehicles are capable of sensing their own environments and moving safely. Elon Musk, for example, says Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will have fully autonomous cars ready this year.“I feel like we are very close. I remain confident that we will have the basic functionality for level five autonomy complete this year. There are no fundamental challenges remaining,” he said, as quoted by BBC News.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn addition, Hyundai-Aptiv is promising commercial autonomous vehicles by 2022.Also, according to Forbes contributor, Jennifer Leigh Parker:Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY) is allocating $52 billion into the autonomous race.General Motors (NYSE:GM) set aside $20 billion.Ford (NYSE:F) set aside $4 billion with plans to launch a self-driving service by 2022.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) set aside $1 billion, and acquired Zoox, a developer of autonomous vehicles.However, there are still plenty of obstacles, including issues with sensors, which must be able to work in all weather conditions, say The Conversation contributors. For example, a Tesla auto-pilot car hit two parked cars in July 2020.At the same time, autonomous cars must also overcome issues with machine learning, or how such technology should be “trained, tested, or validated.” We need to know how these cars would operate, if they will be socially accepted and if regulations allow them on the road.8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short ListChallenges for not, the race is on to get autonomous vehicles on the road.
