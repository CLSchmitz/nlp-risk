Source: Johnson Controls    Source: Johnson Controls   Johnson Controls International Plc plans to sell more green bonds after first issuing the debt this month, predicting companies that borrow for environmentally friendly projects will be rewarded with lower funding costs.    “The investment market is bound for some sort of disruption,” the company’s Treasurer, Marc Vandiepenbeeck, said in an interview. “People will want to see sustainable companies being rewarded differently than they have been so far.”    {""contentId"":""QGR82KT1UM0Z01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-24/johnson-controls-plans-more-green-bonds-to-tap-growing-demand""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QGR82KT1UM0Z01""}   {""contentId"":""QGR82KT1UM0Z01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-24/johnson-controls-plans-more-green-bonds-to-tap-growing-demand""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QGR82KT1UM0Z01""}     Explore dynamic updates of the earth’s key data points       Open the Data Dash     Close           {""contentId"":""QGR82KT1UM0Z01"",""position"":""greensponsoredby"",""dimensions"":{""small_desktop"":[[190,31]],""large_desktop"":[[190,31]],""tablet"":[[190,31]],""mobile"":[[190,31]]},""positionIncrement"":2,""targeting"":{""position"":""greensponsoredby2"",""positionIncrement"":2,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-24/johnson-controls-plans-more-green-bonds-to-tap-growing-demand""},""containerId"":""greensponsoredby-LwKBo81""}   The heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment provider sold $625 million of green debt and wants to be a “much more frequent issuer,” he said, noting that the focus of younger investors on environmental, social and governance issues creates an opportunity for borrowers.    {""contentId"":""QGR82KT1UM0Z01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-24/johnson-controls-plans-more-green-bonds-to-tap-growing-demand""},""containerId"":""box-ev7o7s5""}   Those joining the booming green bond market are increasingly seeing cost benefits. In the U.S., Verizon Communications Inc.’s recent green deal priced at lower yields than existing debt. In Europe, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and Orange SA sold bonds with environmental elements this month at significantly cheaper cost than their other notes.    Johnson Controls was able to “shave off mid-to-high single digits” basis points on the cost of funds compared to non-green debt with its debut, according to Christophe Dugardyn, director of global capital markets at ING Financial Markets LLC, which was one of the lead managers of the sale. “We priced aggressively,” he said.

In addition, the securities support the company’s sustainability goals, which include cutting greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage.

The Cork, Ireland-based firm with offices in Milwaukee intends to allocate an amount equal to net proceeds from the green issuance to fund eligible projects in categories like green buildings and sustainable water and wastewater management, according to its framework.  {""contentId"":""QGR82KT1UM0Z01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-24/johnson-controls-plans-more-green-bonds-to-tap-growing-demand""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QGR82KT1UM0Z01""}   More deals of different maturities and sizes would allow the company to create a green bond maturity curve over time, said Vandiepenbeeck. The dollar-denominated green sale was followed by a 1 billion euro bond in two tranches to refinance European debt coming due in the next 12 months.  {""contentId"":""QGR82KT1UM0Z01"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-24/johnson-controls-plans-more-green-bonds-to-tap-growing-demand""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QGR82KT1UM0Z01""}   “My hope would be to be able to build a curve and be able to see what the net value is of those green and ESG focused investors, not just on the primary issuance but also on the secondary,” said Vandiepenbeeck.
