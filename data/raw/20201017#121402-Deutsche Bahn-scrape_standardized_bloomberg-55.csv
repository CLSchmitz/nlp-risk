A conductor was found guilty and received a suspended sentence of one year for alerting his colleagues, rather than trying to put out the flames, when clothing hung near a heating board caught fire, AFP said.    Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s state-owned railway, has installed some safety equipment following the incident, the Berlin-based company said today in a statement that took note of the French court ruling clearing the German train operator.
