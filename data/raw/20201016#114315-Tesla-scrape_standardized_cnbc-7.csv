The large transaction, he quickly surmised, was a “butt dial” or accidental purchase made through the Tesla app on his iPhone.“My phone was in my jeans,” Vaziri told CNBC. “I took it out, put it on this charger that comes with your Tesla and that’s it. A minute later? I got the text. I’ve never purchased anything through the Tesla app before.” Vaziri had owned the electric sedan happily for less than a few months at the point of his accidental purchase. He linked a credit card to his Tesla account, he said, to pay a monthly fee for “premium connectivity” in the car. (That service enables features like live traffic visualization, satellite maps, video and music streaming over cellular and wifi networks.) The same card was billed for “Enhanced Autopilot,” a $4,000 software upgrade that would enhance the driver assistance features of the car.Available for a very limited time this year, the September 2020 version of Enhanced Autopilot included an automatic navigation feature, automatic lane changing and parking, and a “Summon” feature that lets drivers step out of their vehicles, then park them using a key fob or Tesla app as a remote control of sorts.The Enhanced Autopilot features were not suitable for use off of highways, or in public parking lots, according to the Tesla Owner’s Manual. Vaziri says that’s one reason he wasn’t interested in buying the upgrade.
