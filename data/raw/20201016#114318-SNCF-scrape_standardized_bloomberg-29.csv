The stake will be sold for 585.1 million pounds ($900 million) and Eurostar will also redeem the government’s preference share, valued at 172 million pounds, the Treasury said in a statement Wednesday. The price achieved is “significantly ahead” of expectations and the sale is expected to be closed in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval, it said.    {""contentId"":""NKNCM46K50YD01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2015-03-04/u-k-to-sell-eurostar-stake-to-cdpq-hermes-for-900-million""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-NKNCM46K50YD01""}   {""contentId"":""NKNCM46K50YD01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2015-03-04/u-k-to-sell-eurostar-stake-to-cdpq-hermes-for-900-million""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-NKNCM46K50YD01""}   “It’s great that we have reached an agreement to sell the U.K.’s shareholding in Eurostar that delivers a fantastic deal for U.K. taxpayers that exceeds expectations,” Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in the statement. “Investing in the best quality infrastructure for Britain, getting the best value for money for the taxpayer and tackling our country’s debts are key parts of our long-term economic plan.”    {""contentId"":""NKNCM46K50YD01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2015-03-04/u-k-to-sell-eurostar-stake-to-cdpq-hermes-for-900-million""},""containerId"":""box-a03cSp8""}   The government announced in 2013 that it was seeking buyers for the stake in Eurostar as part of its National Infrastructure Plan, which aims to raise 20 billion pounds from corporate and financial asset sales by 2020. The U.K. is the No. 2 shareholder in Eurostar, with the French government holding 55 percent via state rail company SNCF. Belgium railway SNCB owns the rest.    CDPQ will own a 30 percent stake of Eurostar, and Hermes Infrastructure 10 percent, according to the Treasury. RBC Capital Markets advised the buyers’ consortium, while UBS Group AG acted as adviser to the Treasury.  (Updates with advisers in final paragraph.)
