We also won’t allow ads with content that seeks to delegitimize the outcome of an election,” tweeted Rob Leathern, Facebook director of product management. This policy will prohibit any ads that call specific methods of voting, such as voting by mail, as being inherently fraudulent or corrupt, Leathern said. It will also prohibit the use of isolated incidents of voter fraud to delegitimize the result of an election, he added. Facebook’s policy change comes as President Donald Trump has used social media to make false claims that voting by mail leads to election fraud. Trump has refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose. The new policy will apply to ads on Facebook and Instagram effective immediately, Leathern said.
