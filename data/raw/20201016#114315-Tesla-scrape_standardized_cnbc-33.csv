Doing this helps encourage employees, internally, and manage investor expectations externally, as Tesla approaches its deadline for vehicle production and deliveries. Like other automakers, Tesla reports these numbers on a quarterly basis ahead of earnings.Electrek previously reported on the email.Tesla delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019, its best on record, and 88,400 in the first quarter of 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, Tesla said it delivered 90,650 vehicles, which beat analysts’ expectations given the Covid-19 pandemic’s effect on production and demand.
