Thousands of miles away, the bodies of other  migrants washed up on a Turkish beach. Photos of a drowned toddler face down in the surf spread  quickly across the Internet, yet another searing image from Europe’s worst  migration crisis since the 1990s Balkan wars. Outside a Budapest train station, an angry crowd  camped out demanding to board trains for Germany, as Europe’s asylum system crumbled  under the strain of the influx. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing wars, as  well as economic migrants escaping poverty, have arrived in the European Union, confounding  EU leaders and feeding the rise of right wing populists. Thousands have drowned in the Mediterranean and  many others have died travelling over land, including 71 people found in the back of an  abandoned truck in Austria last week. The EU’s executive European Commission promised to  unveil a new policy next week to make it easier to process asylum claims, send those from  safe countries home and distribute bona fide refugees among the bloc’s 28  members.
