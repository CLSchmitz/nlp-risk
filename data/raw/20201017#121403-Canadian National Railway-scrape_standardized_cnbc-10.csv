But Virginia-based Norfolk Southern had continually rebuffed its  advances.  “We have long recognized that consolidation is necessary for the  North American rail industry to meet the demands of a growing  economy, but with no clear path to a friendly merger at this  time, we will turn all of our focus and energy to serving our  customers and creating long term value for CP shareholders,” CP  Chief Executive Hunter Harrison said in a statement.  A number of Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including all the  party’s representatives from Illinois and Pennsylvania, have  spoken out against a merger."
