There is a lot to do, but there might be one or other investment opportunities. Investment is always an option,” said Diess.China announced last week that it would open up the market to foreign automakers, which have been encumbered by ownership limitations in the country for more than two decades.The restrictions, which prevented foreign car makers from owning more than a 50 percent share of any local venture, will be lifted incrementally over the next four years. Manufacturers of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will be the first to benefit, starting this year, followed by makers of commercial vehicles in 2020 and the wider car market by 2022.The move is part of China’s efforts to make its domestic autos industry more flexible and establish itself as a leader in electric cars.Diess dubbed the policy shift as a “positive move forward” that would generate further growth and investment in China.His comments came in the first sit-down interview since he was appointed as head of the German automaker on April 12, 2018. He will assume the role from August 2018.
