The Facebook Audience Network allows mobile software developers to provide in-app advertisements targeted to users based on Facebook’s data.Today, advertisers can use a unique device ID number called the IDFA to better target ads and estimate their effectiveness. In iOS 14, each app that wants to use these identifiers will ask users to opt in to tracking when the app is first launched. Facebook said its apps will not collect IDFA information on iOS 14.
