Its wish for the government to take a direct stake in Lufthansa is putting the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Lufthansa employees at risk. It's completely irresponsible,"" said Michael Theurer, a senior member of the opposition Free Democrats (FDP).Vanessa Golz, who covers Lufthansa for investment fund Deka, which owns 0.9% of the airline, said there was no question it needed a bailout and time was pressing.""If the position of the shareholders can be improved, this is to be welcomed, but with a sense of proportion. The task now is to draw up a future concept for a 'new Lufthansa' as quickly as possible. Otherwise there are only losers: Lufthansa employees, the taxpayer and the shareholders,"" she said.Patrick Schuchter, portfolio manager at Union Investment, said his company would approve the state rescue, but wanted the interests of existing shareholders taken more into account in the design of the rescue package.Lufthansa shareholders must register to attend the shareholder meeting by June 20 and if more than 50% attend, a simple majority would suffice, the airline said.As of June 4, 85% of Lufthansa's shareholders were based in Germany.Thiele said an indirect government participation via German state-owned development bank KfW could be an alternative to an outright stake.Under the deal, the government could raise its stake to 25% plus one share in the event of a takeover attempt and the airline must transfer up to 24 takeoff and landing slots in Frankfurt and Munich to rivals.With many of its planes grounded because of the pandemic, Lufthansa said on Monday it was seeking to strike agreements with worker representatives by June 22 on how to make job cuts equivalent to 22,000 full-time positions.($1 = 0.8877 euros)(Reporting by Michelle Martin in Berlin, Ilona Wissenbach in Frankfurt and Joern Poltz in Munich; Editing by Keith Weir, David Clarke and Elaine Hardcastle)"
