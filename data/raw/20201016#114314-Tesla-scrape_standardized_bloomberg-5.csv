Ford will fall short because of a recall of plug-in hybrid sport-utility vehicles, it said Wednesday. The carmaker is recalling 20,500 Kuga SUVs in Europe after seven caught fire while charging.    {""contentId"":""QI7GVMT0G1L901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-14/ford-to-fall-short-of-europe-emission-rules-after-hybrid-recall""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QI7GVMT0G1L901""}   {""contentId"":""QI7GVMT0G1L901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-14/ford-to-fall-short-of-europe-emission-rules-after-hybrid-recall""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QI7GVMT0G1L901""}     Explore dynamic updates of the earth’s key data points       Open the Data Dash     Close             Meerut, India Most polluted air today, in sensor range        0   6   5   4   3   2    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   4   3   2   1   0   .   0   0   9   8   7   6    0   2   1   0   9   8    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   7   6   5   4   3    0   0   9   8   7   6    0   6   5   4   3   2     Parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere       +0.​97° C   Sep. 2020 increase in global temperature vs. 1900s average       34%   Carbon-free net power in Germany, most recent data          0   5   4   3   2   1    0   1   0   9   8   7    0   6   5   4   3   2     Soccer pitches of forest lost this hour, most recent data           $69.​9B    Renewable power investment worldwide in Q2 2020     -38.​64%   Today's arctic ice area vs. historic average           50,​820    Million metric tons of greenhouse emissions, most recent annual data     {""contentId"":""QI7GVMT0G1L901"",""position"":""greensponsoredby"",""dimensions"":{""small_desktop"":[[190,31]],""large_desktop"":[[190,31]],""tablet"":[[190,31]],""mobile"":[[190,31]]},""positionIncrement"":2,""targeting"":{""position"":""greensponsoredby2"",""positionIncrement"":2,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-14/ford-to-fall-short-of-europe-emission-rules-after-hybrid-recall""},""containerId"":""greensponsoredby-K2qLulk""}   The company stopped selling the model in European countries in early September, and it’s delaying until next year the launch of the mechanically similar Escape plug-in hybrid in the U.S.    {""contentId"":""QI7GVMT0G1L901"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-14/ford-to-fall-short-of-europe-emission-rules-after-hybrid-recall""},""containerId"":""box-ybXTXkt""}   “We expected to comply with the new regulations, even factoring in Covid-related disruption to our manufacturing,” Ford said in a statement. “However, the current issues with the Kuga PHEV resulting in a stop-ship and stop-sale have affected our plan.”     More from       California Braces for Another Day of Heat, Wind and Fires      Ramaphosa Outlines Plan to Spur South African Recovery      Japan to Release Treated Fukushima Water in Sea, Kyodo Says      Nikola CEO Says Startup’s Plans Intact Even If GM Deal Unravels    It’s now planning to team up with other as-yet unnamed automakers to meet the regulations, as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has done with Tesla Inc. in Europe.

The French automaker has filed notice with European regulators that it is open to pooling emissions with others.  Ford declined to comment on whether it plans to achieve the C02 targets on its own next year.  Cusp of Achieving  Plug-in hybrids like the Kuga and the Escape are a key part of Ford’s strategy to spend $11.5 billion electrifying its lineup as it makes the transition to battery-powered vehicles. The automaker is scheduled to begin building its electric Mustang Mach-E in Mexico later this year, but that model won’t go on sale in Europe until 2021.   The EU rules taking effect this year force manufacturers to reduce the average emissions of all the cars they sell in the region to 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer or face hefty fines. As a result, companies are accelerating the introduction of a range of new plug-in hybrid and fully-electric vehicles, while at the same time countries -- including France, Italy and Germany -- have boosted consumer incentives to buy low- or zero-emission models.  {""contentId"":""QI7GVMT0G1L901"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-14/ford-to-fall-short-of-europe-emission-rules-after-hybrid-recall""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QI7GVMT0G1L901""}   Sales of battery-powered vehicles tripled in Europe in the first half of the year, helping to cut CO2 emissions of new cars by 9% to 111 grams per kilometer, the steepest drop in more than a decade, according to a report by researcher Transport & Environment.  PSA Group and Volvo Cars, along with BMW AG and Renault, were among carmakers on track to meet the new emission rules, according to the report. Ford was also on the cusp of achieving the standards before it recalled the plug-in Kuga hybrid.  Ford said it anticipates exceeding CO2 targets on the light-commercial-vehicle side of its business and has registered to pool with other automakers to help achieve the standards in that segment.
