Organisations sometimes delay security fixes to ERP software for months or even years out of concern that doing so could disrupt the critical functions the programs support, including manufacturing, sales and finance, Nunez said.Risks also arise from technical installation mistakes or growing moves to hook up traditionally back-office business systems to the cloud in order to reach mobile or online users.In its latest research, Onapsis, together with web monitoring firm Digital Shadows, identified some 17,000 SAP and Oracle software installations exposed to the internet at more than 3,000 top companies, government agencies and universities.At least 10,000 servers are running incorrectly configured software that could subject them to direct attack using known SAP or Oracle exploits, the report’s authors warned.More than 4,000 known bugs in SAP and 5,000 in Oracle software pose security threats, especially in older systems that operators may consider uneconomical to fix, according to the report from Onapsis and Digital Shadows due out on Wednesday.Digital Shadows combed through Google searches, social media chatter and the dark web where they found discussions in Chinese and Russian hacker forums regarding how to use specific SAP and Oracle vulnerabilities.The ERP study by Onapsis and Digital Shadows is available for download at https://goo.gl/pWbz3Q
