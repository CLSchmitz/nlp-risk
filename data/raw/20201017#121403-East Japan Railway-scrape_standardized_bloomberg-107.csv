On the west coast, the secretary of California’s Natural Resources Agency responded to Trump’s assertion that cooler temperatures would bring some relief to the fires: “I wish science agreed with you,” Wade Crowfoot said.  “I don’t think science knows, actually,” Trump replied.  Science may have the last word. Scientific American abandoned its 175-year record of impartiality yesterday to endorse Trump’s rival Joe Biden as president. “We are compelled to do so,” the magazine said in an op-ed.    #lazy-img-364686081:before{padding-top:66.64999999999999%;} An American flag blows in the wind in front of a burning home in Vacaville, California, on Aug. 19.Photographer: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images  Tell us how we’re doing or what we’re missing at balancepower@bloomberg.net.

Fine print | The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed accords with Israel yesterday that Trump hailed as a “foundation for a comprehensive peace” in the Middle East and touted as a crowning achievement of his presidency. Yet, as Nick Wadhams reports, the documents’ sweeping promises — especially between the UAE and Israel — left key questions unanswered.    #lazy-img-364685999:before{padding-top:66.64999999999999%;} The signing ceremony yesterday at the White House.

Volte face | Italy surprised Europe last year when it became the first Group of Seven nation to sign up to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road infrastructure and trade initiative.

Argentina is tightening the screws on its foreign exchange market in a bid to restrict demand for U.S. dollars as reserves dwindle and the gap widens between the official and black market exchange rates.   Japan’s parliament formally elected ruling party stalwart Yoshihide Suga — the 71-year-old son of a strawberry farmer — to be the country’s first new prime minister in almost eight years.
