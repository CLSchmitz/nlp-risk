The U.K. Department for Transport plans to revise the country’s rail contracts and told bidders that a new agreement for the so-called West Coast line would not start until January 2013, instead of April 2012 as originally planned, the newspaper reported. The bidders shortlisted for the contract are FirstGroup Plc, Dutch-owned operator Abellio, SNCF of France and Virgin Trains, a joint venture between Richard Branson’s Virgin Group and Stagecoach Group Plc, according to the Observer. Virgin Trains has operated the line since 1997.     Published on ‎15‎ ‎May‎, ‎2011‎ ‎12‎:‎23        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
