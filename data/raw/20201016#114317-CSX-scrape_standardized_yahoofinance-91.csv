Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.A 1.3% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests CSX has some staying power. During the year, the company also conducted a buyback equivalent to around 8.0% of its market capitalisation. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on CSX! <img alt=""NasdaqGS:CSX Historical Dividend Yield, December 15th 2019"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hKVfHlZQsaMjJn_D.eRWbA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/b6e31b40fd6a01bc6d12690f42c63ce9"" class=""caas-img"">NasdaqGS:CSX Historical Dividend Yield, December 15th 2019Payout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 22% of CSX's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. We like this low payout ratio, because it implies the dividend is well covered and leaves ample opportunity for reinvestment.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. CSX's cash payout ratio last year was 23%. Cash flows are typically lumpy, but this looks like an appropriately conservative payout. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Is CSX's Balance Sheet Risky?As CSX has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 2.22 times its EBITDA, CSX has a noticeable amount of debt, although if business stays steady, this may not be overly concerning.Story continuesWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. CSX has EBIT of 7.34 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.Consider getting  our latest analysis on CSX's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of CSX's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.29 in 2009, compared to US$0.96 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time.Dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. It's good to see CSX has been growing its earnings per share at 18% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share are growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low. We think this is an ideal combination in a dividend stock.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, we like that the company's dividend payments appear well covered, although the retained capital also needs to be effectively reinvested. Next, growing earnings per share and steady dividend payments is a great combination. Overall, we think there are a lot of positives to CSX from a dividend perspective.Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
