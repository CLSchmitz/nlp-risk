It should be. On February 27th we publish an article with the title ""Recession is Imminent: We Need A Travel Ban NOW"". We predicted that a US recession is imminent and US stocks will go down by at least 20% in the next 3-6 months. We also told you to short the market ETFs and buy long-term bonds. Investors who agreed with us and replicated these trades are up double digits whereas the market is down double digits. Our article also called for a total international travel ban to prevent the spread of the coronavirus especially from Europe. We were one step ahead of the markets and the president.In these volatile markets we scrutinize hedge fund filings to get a reading on which direction each stock might be going.

After all, these people have access to smartest analysts and expensive data/information sources that individual investors can't match.
