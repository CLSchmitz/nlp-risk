Tesla shares fell as much as 6% and were down 5.2% at $425.97 as of 9:50 a.m. in New York. The pull-back comes after massive gains in recent months fueled in part by anticipation of Tuesday’s event. Musk said the information he’ll announce will affect production of Tesla’s Semi, Cybertruck and Roadster models, all of which have been unveiled in the form of prototypes but are still in development.       Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 21, 2020     Explore dynamic updates of the earth’s key data points       Open the Data Dash     Close              50,​820    Million metric tons of greenhouse emissions, most recent annual data     34%   Carbon-free net power in Germany, most recent data       -38.​64%   Today's arctic ice area vs. historic average          0   3   2   1   0   9   ,   0   4   3   2   1   0    0   7   6   5   4   3    0   9   8   7   6   5     Soccer pitches of forest lost this hour, most recent data          0   6   5   4   3   2    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   4   3   2   1   0   .   0   0   9   8   7   6    0   2   1   0   9   8    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   9   8   7   6   5    0   4   3   2   1   0    0   7   6   5   4   3     Parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere           $69.​9B    Renewable power investment worldwide in Q2 2020     +0.​97° C   Sep. 2020 increase in global temperature vs. 1900s average          Meerut, India Most polluted air today, in sensor range     {""contentId"":""QH117TDWLU6H01"",""position"":""greensponsoredby"",""dimensions"":{""small_desktop"":[[190,31]],""large_desktop"":[[190,31]],""tablet"":[[190,31]],""mobile"":[[190,31]]},""positionIncrement"":2,""targeting"":{""position"":""greensponsoredby2"",""positionIncrement"":2,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-21/musk-implies-tesla-must-make-own-battery-cells-to-meet-ev-demand""},""containerId"":""greensponsoredby-jjKtz62""}   In another tweet, Musk warned of the “extreme difficulty” of scaling up production of new technology. It was the latest in a series of posts that were more measured about the much-hyped event the chief executive officer had previously talked up. The company’s shareholder meeting and subsequent battery briefing get underway starting at 1:30 p.m. local time in California.    {""contentId"":""QH117TDWLU6H01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-21/musk-implies-tesla-must-make-own-battery-cells-to-meet-ev-demand""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QH117TDWLU6H01""}   {""contentId"":""QH117TDWLU6H01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-21/musk-implies-tesla-must-make-own-battery-cells-to-meet-ev-demand""},""containerId"":""box-yZ1FbX4""}   Musk said in another tweet that Tesla will need to start producing its own battery cells to support its various products, even as it ramps up purchases from outside suppliers. He wrote that the company expects there to be significant shortages of cells in 2022 and beyond unless it ramps up output of its own.    {""contentId"":""QH117TDWLU6H01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-21/musk-implies-tesla-must-make-own-battery-cells-to-meet-ev-demand""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QH117TDWLU6H01""}   Tesla’s most important and longstanding partner on batteries is Osaka-based Panasonic Corp. The two companies jointly operate a massive plant outside of Reno, Nevada, where Panasonic makes the cells and Tesla manufactures battery packs for its cars.  But Musk has never been keen about depending on one supplier, and Tesla does have smaller-scale agreements with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, in China’s Fujian province and LG Chem Ltd. in Seoul.
