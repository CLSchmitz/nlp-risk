California is Tesla’s largest market and could become even bigger with an order or goal like this from the state.Story continuesCalifornia also put an emphasis on bringing more electric charging stations to the state, which is seen as a positive for Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ: BLNK) and ChargePoint, which is merging with the SPAC Switchback Energy Acquisition (NYSE: SBE).See more from BenzingaOptions Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade IdeasBofA: Auto Parts Retailers Have Strong Margins In 0B MarketMolson Coors Continues Hard Seltzer Push With Coca-Cola Topo Chico Deal© 2020 Benzinga.com.
