It said banks will sell shares based on directives from Tesla.“We intend to use the net proceeds, if any, from this offering to further strengthen our balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes,” Tesla said. The stock briefly traded in the green on Tuesday, but moved lower throughout afternoon trading and ended the session 4.67% lower.The decline hardly dents shares’ rapid appreciation this year. Through Monday’s close, the electric car maker has gained nearly 500% in 2020. In the last year, shares have gained 1,004% compared with the S&P 500′s 20% rise.Tesla’s run-up has only gained steam since the company announced its 5-for-1 stock split on Aug. 11. In that time, Tesla shares have rallied 81.3%. That gain includes a 12.6% pop on Monday, when the split took effect. That rise came even though stock splits are purely cosmetic, meaning nothing about the company’s underlying business changes.
