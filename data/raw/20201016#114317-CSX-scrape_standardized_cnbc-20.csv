CSX and other U.S. transportation providers are widely seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy.Third-quarter revenue increased 14 percent from a year ago to $3.13 billion.“The price increases that CSX receives for shipments are picking up” due to the tight trucking market that benefits both the Jacksonville, Florida-based company’s container and general merchandise businesses, Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman said in a client note.Expenses fell 2 percent from a year earlier to $1.84 billion, as costs associated with increased volume and higher fuel prices were more than offset by efficiency gains. CSX has already hit its target of reducing headcount by 2,000 and executives vowed to make further cuts next year.CSX Chief Executive James Foote told Reuters that tariffs on aluminum, steel and soybeans have had minimal to no impact on the railroad and that a simmering trade war with China has not been a negative for the U.S. economy.CSX hit its turnaround goal of driving down operating expenses as a percentage of revenue earlier than analysts expected, and Foote said the railroad has more opportunities to reduce overhead and boost revenue.“We have a ton more to do” to continue to improve efficiency and grow the business, Foote told Reuters.
