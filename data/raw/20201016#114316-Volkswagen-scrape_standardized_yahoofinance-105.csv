We are doing the latter,"" said Wolfgang Maluche, vice president of engineering, Volkswagen of America. (https://bit.ly/30RoLF9)Volkswagen's plan to produce its own cells and battery packs for electric vehicles in the United States follows an emissions scandal at the company, which admitted to using illegal software to cheat pollution tests in the country.The scandal has cost Volkswagen 30 billion euros ($35.51 billion) in fines, penalties and vehicle buyback costs worldwide.Insourcing electric vehicle cells and battery packs reinforces Volkswagen as one of the most ambitious traditional carmakers in the electric vehicle domain, Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said.Last year, the carmaker said it would invest $800 million to build a new electric vehicle at its plant in Chattanooga.
