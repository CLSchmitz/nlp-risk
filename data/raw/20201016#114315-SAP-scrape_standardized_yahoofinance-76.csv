SAP referred questions on the status of the project to the government.Governments have been debating how to monitor citizens to help slow the spread of the virus, using home-built systems or building on top of a framework created by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. In the U.K., the National Health Service said Monday that it would build its own app, joining countries like Australia and Singapore.Germany said Sunday it would opt for a decentralized solution to help monitor those who have contracted Covid-19 and alert people who have come into contact with the infected patients. A group of German startups also had been in talks with the government about developing an app that would help trace people who have been exposed to the virus.Under a decentralized system, contact-tracing apps collect anonymous data about nearby mobile phones using Bluetooth technology through tools such as those being built by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Once an infection is confirmed, that information is sent to a server. People with devices using the app could learn if they had been in proximity to a confirmed infection without revealing the patient’s identity.“A decentralized solution would create more trust among users,” Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Monday.Germany’s decision throws weight behind proponents of that approach who’ve clashed with supporters of a centralized method, which, by contrast, could allow someone’s contacts to be uploaded to government servers where authorities would then decide who to inform of a possible infection. Privacy supporters have opposed that method, saying it hands too much information to authorities that could be used for other, more malicious reasons after the crisis passes.Story continues(Updated with additional context)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.
