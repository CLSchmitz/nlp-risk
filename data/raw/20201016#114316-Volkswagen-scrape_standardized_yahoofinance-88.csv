(https://bit.ly/3lcO6l3)Since hitting a bottom in April, auto sales have seen a V-shaped recovery as economies reopen following easing of lockdowns, resulting in major automakers scrambling to ramp up production and boost weak inventories at dealerships.China has been among the strongest markets to recover, the auto consultant said, with the United States seeing a tempered rebound amid a renewed surge in COVID-19 cases.Western Europe produced a 'normal' market level in July, while India and Brazil, though slow to recover, were now gaining traction, the firm said.LMC, however, remains concerned if the pace of sales in July can be sustained through the rest of the year, as pent-up demand slows and government incentives expire.""When job and business support schemes end, or are tapered, a renewed macroeconomic slump could emerge, damaging underlying vehicle demand,"" the firm said.
