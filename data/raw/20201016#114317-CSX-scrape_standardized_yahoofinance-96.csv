Price and EPS SurpriseBox, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Box, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayBox invested in security, compliance and administrative technology during the fiscal third quarter. These investments with leading enterprises helped the company to capitalize on increasing adoption of cloud computing technologies and the need for secure collaboration. This in turn is likely to have driven top-line growth in the quarter to be reported.During the quarter, Box rode high on the back of increasing adoption of the cloud content management platform by existing and new customers. Expanding paid customer base is anticipated to have aided its top-line growth for the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, strength across international markets and growing add-on products might have aided the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings.However, weakness in the EMEA region may reflect on its upcoming results.
