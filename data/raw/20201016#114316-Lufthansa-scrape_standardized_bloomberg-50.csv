Bloomberg was first to report the offer on Saturday.    {""contentId"":""QEFVL1DWX2PS01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-02/siemens-arm-s-16-4-billion-varian-purchase-opens-path-to-dax""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QEFVL1DWX2PS01""}   {""contentId"":""QEFVL1DWX2PS01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-02/siemens-arm-s-16-4-billion-varian-purchase-opens-path-to-dax""},""containerId"":""box-g7zOllx""}   With Varian, Healthineers will gain market share in devices and software used for cancer therapy. Recent developments in radiation therapy, coupled with more precise imaging, have been linked to lower cancer death rates, which Montag said the company is keen to capitalize on.    {""contentId"":""QEFVL1DWX2PS01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-02/siemens-arm-s-16-4-billion-varian-purchase-opens-path-to-dax""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QEFVL1DWX2PS01""}   The deal has “clear strategic rationale,” Citigroup analyst Kate Kalashnikova said in a note. “The combined company will have the most comprehensive cancer portfolio in the industry.”  Shares of Siemens Healthineers declined 1% to 43.50 euros as of 9:04 a.m. in Frankfurt. Varian jumped 23% to $176 in premarket trading.  {""contentId"":""QEFVL1DWX2PS01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-02/siemens-arm-s-16-4-billion-varian-purchase-opens-path-to-dax""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QEFVL1DWX2PS01""}   “Varian will get access to our broad clinical data pool, which will enable us to more quickly develop a wider range of personalized and precise therapies,” Montag said in a call Sunday.  The deal is the biggest health-care acquisition this year.  Siemens Holding  The purchase will be financed through both debt and equity, Siemens Healthineers said. That includes a 15.2 billion-euro ($17.9 billion) bridge loan from parent Siemens AG, followed by a capital increase this year that Siemens won’t participate in.  {""contentId"":""QEFVL1DWX2PS01"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-02/siemens-arm-s-16-4-billion-varian-purchase-opens-path-to-dax""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QEFVL1DWX2PS01""}   As a result, the parent company’s stake in Healthineers will decline to about 72% from 85%, Siemens said.   What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:  Siemens Healthineers’ proposed purchase of Varian Medical Systems is at a hefty 28% premium to 2021 consensus EV/Ebitda estimates. The price tag seems partly based on the 300 million euros of synergies Healthineers targets by 2025, mainly from revenue opportunities.  Johnson Imode, BI industrials analyst  Healthineers Paying Varian Premium as Siemens Eases Grip: React  Healthineers’ possible inclusion in the DAX index has been a burning question for investors and analysts since the company was brought to market by Siemens in 2018. Because of Healthineers’ small free share float, the company has been left out despite an almost 44 billion-euro market capitalization.  Joining Germany’s largest companies in the benchmark index would raise Healthineers’ profile with investors and signal further independence from Siemens. Acceptance into the index would also force the many investment funds that track the DAX to buy the company’s shares.  The index has seen more turmoil than usual recently, with Deutsche Lufthansa AG exiting after 32 years. Scandal-plagued Wirecard AG may be the next to depart.  {""contentId"":""QEFVL1DWX2PS01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-02/siemens-arm-s-16-4-billion-varian-purchase-opens-path-to-dax""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-2-QEFVL1DWX2PS01""}   — With assistance by Manus Cranny, Nejra Cehic, and Jan-Patrick Barnert  (Adds analyst reaction and share move from fourth paragraph)   Published on ‎3‎ ‎August‎, ‎2020‎ ‎01‎:‎00  Updated on  ‎3‎ ‎August‎, ‎2020‎ ‎09‎:‎09        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
