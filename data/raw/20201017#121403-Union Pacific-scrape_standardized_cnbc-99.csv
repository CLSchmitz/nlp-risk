Gavin Newsom will propose a 10% pay cut for state workers on Thursday, according to two labor union leaders, part of his plan to fill a projected $54.3 billion budget deficit caused by the coronavirus-induced economic downturn.SEIU Local 1000 President Yvonne Walker said in a Facebook video that Newsom’s office informed her of the proposed cut on Wednesday. Tim Edwards, president of the union representing state firefighters, said the proposal would not spare them even as the state enters wildfire season.A state official with knowledge of the budget confirmed the proposal, adding it will be part of the collective bargaining process. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information ahead of Newsom’s formal announcement expected later Thursday.If the Newsom administration fails to achieve the necessary savings through negotiation, the governor could order furloughs instead. The pay cuts could be revisited should the federal government approve another aid package for state and local governments. Newsom and the leaders of four other western states have asked Congress for an additional $1 trillion.Walker said the union will try to negotiate an alternative plan. Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We can call the bargaining team together and we can figure out the equivalent of what that 10% represents and try to negotiate something,” Walker said. “Yeah, there might be a little pain involved but it won’t be the same as two furlough days.”
