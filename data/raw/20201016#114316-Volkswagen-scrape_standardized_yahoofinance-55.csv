But new supportive policies will require local city governments and companies to build up a more mature supply chain and business model for the industry.Three industry sources familiar with policy discussions said authorities could announce a new policy as early as this month.Pilot cities will likely include Beijing, Shanghai, as well as those in northern Shanxi and eastern Jiangsu provinces, according to sources, who declined to be named as the issue is not public.The Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Some global automakers from Toyota Motor to Hyundai Motor have already announced plans for hydrogen vehicles in China.(Reporting by Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)
