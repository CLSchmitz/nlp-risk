The index got a lift last week after a big chunk of companies posted better-than-expected earnings. It was also boosted by improving sentiment around Brexit and U.S.-China trade negotiations.The all-time high could be tested as about 120 S&P 500 companies, or around 24%, are scheduled to release their quarterly results this week. Those companies include Caterpillar and Boeing, both of which are expected to report Wednesday morning. Amazon, Intel, McDonald’s and Chipotle Mexican Grill are also on deck for the week.“You’ve got the potential for a combination of things that drive us to new highs,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “At the same time you’re getting better micro data in the earnings, you’re getting better news on the macro hurdles facing us.”
