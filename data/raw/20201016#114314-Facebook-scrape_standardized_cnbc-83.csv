I used it to buy speakers, TVs and old microwaves. But, when it came time for me to start prepping for a move two months ago, I turned to Facebook Marketplace instead.I sold most of the household items I didn’t need on Facebook Marketplace. I used it to sell everything from a blender to gardening tools and some scuba fins. I even bartered a few old camping tents my roommate left behind for two cases of White Claw. Facebook introduced Marketplace in 2016 to little fanfare. At the time, the feature seemed like yet another lackluster effort by Facebook to clone someone else’s app. Facebook was the latest in a long line of apps to try and pitch itself as a Craigslist killer. Many had tried, but none had been able to unseat the minimalist website when it came to buying and selling used goods. But, unlike other wannabe Craigslist killers, Facebook Marketplace has endured and improved over the years. These days, it’s the app I use most when I need to sell stuff. Facebook Marketplace has several advantages that make it easier, faster and more trustworthy than Craigslist.
