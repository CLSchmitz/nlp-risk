Our updated guidance demonstrates that even in this challenging environment SAP remains healthy and stable.”Citi analyst Julian Serafini said SAP’s guidance “implies very soft new business throughout the year ... which in turn implies a strong rebound in out-years in order to meet the maintained 2023 targets.”The company’s shares were indicated to open up 1.3%, having declined by 13% in the current year to date.Prompted by German stock exchange rules that require listed companies to report material divergences in results or changes to guidance, SAP said that its adjusted operating profit edged 1% higher to 1.48 billion euros in the first quarter.    It said that, as the impact of the COVID-19 crisis rapidly intensified towards the end of the first quarter, a significant amount of new business was postponed. This was reflected in a 31% decline in revenue from software licenses — SAP’s cash cow business that generates much of its profits but is ‘lumpy’ because revenue is recognized up front.By contrast, cloud revenue grew by 29% on an adjusted basis at constant currencies. The share of predictable revenue overall grew to 76%, up by 4% year on year.
