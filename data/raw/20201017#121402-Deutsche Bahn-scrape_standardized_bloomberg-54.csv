A former analyst at Barai Capital said he listened in on phone calls when his boss, Samir Barai, got nonpublic information on companies from Jiau. The analyst, Jason Pflaum, 38, testified yesterday in Manhattan federal court that he also recorded the calls, wrote contemporaneous electronic instant messages and kept notes. Barai didn’t tell anyone on the calls that his assistant was listening in, Pflaum testified.  Jiau, who is charged with passing illegal tips on Nvidia Corp. and Marvell Technology Group Ltd., is set to go on trial June 1 and asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff to suppress the recordings and instant messages. She faces as long as 25 years in prison if convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud.  “I do not agree with the defendant’s interpretation” of the law, Rakoff said yesterday at the pretrial hearing. “Nothing I’ve heard in this hearing really dissuades me from the view that I’ve reached.”  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-2-LL3KD81A74E901""}   Pflaum has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors.

A three-judge panel in New York yesterday granted a request to partially lift a lower-court order that restrained the Ecuadorean residents’ efforts to enforce the Feb. 14 judgment over environmental damage to the Amazon River basin. The court refused the Ecuadorean plaintiffs’ request to put on hold a lawsuit Chevron filed against them now pending in federal court in Manhattan.  The panel also said it would expedite the schedule for hearing the appeal of the restraining order, which blocked the Ecuadoreans from trying to collect the judgment in a U.S. or foreign court anywhere in the world.  The appeals court said the plaintiffs aren’t restrained by the lower-court order “other than commencing, prosecuting or receiving benefit from recognition, enforcement, or prejudgment seizure or attachment proceedings.”  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article3"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article3"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-3-LL3KD81A74E901""}   The appeals court’s decision allows the Ecuadoreans to meet with their American lawyers and raise money to enforce the judgment in the oil-cleanup lawsuit at a later date, Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs, said in an e-mail.  Justin Higgs, a Chevron spokesman, said the company is pleased with yesterday’s ruling, which he said keeps the lower court’s order “in place in all key respects, and rejects the defendants’ efforts to derail the November 2011 trial on the enforceability of the fraudulent Ecuadorean judgment.”  “This injunction was never about whether denying the defendants the right to communicate with their clients or fundraise,” Higgs said in an e-mail. “It was about preventing them from furthering enforcement proceedings and financially benefiting from them, which the Second Circuit has now affirmed they cannot do.”  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""in-article3"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article3"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""in-article-3-LL3KD81A74E901""}   The appeals court case is Chevron Corp. v.

Murdoch’s Choice of Ten CEO Delayed by Australian Judge  Lachlan Murdoch’s choice of James Warburton for the top job at Australian television broadcaster Ten Network Holdings Ltd. was delayed until next year by a judge, who agreed to partly enforce a non-competition order.  Lachlan Murdoch, son of News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, hired Warburton, then sales director at rival Seven Group Holdings Ltd.’s Seven Network, in March. Warburton was scheduled to start as chief executive officer at Ten on July 14. Seven Media Group, or SMG, claimed a non-compete clause in his contract prevented him from taking the job until October 2012.  “I should do no more than the minimum that is reasonably necessary to protect the plaintiffs’ legitimate commercial interests,” New South Wales Supreme Court Judge Michael Pembroke wrote in a 50-page judgment yesterday, barring Warburton from starting before Jan. 1. “There is no justification for restraining him from competition with SMG or any of its subsidiaries beyond 1 January 2012.”  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article4"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article4"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-4-LL3KD81A74E901""}   Ten Network, the least watched of Australia’s three commercial television broadcasters, fired chief executive Grant Blackley in February and appointed Lachlan Murdoch to run the network on an interim basis. A week after his appointment, Lachlan Murdoch hired Warburton to the top job.  Seven had argued that in his job at the network, Warburton gained access to confidential information, including contract terms for talent and advertisers, that he could use to unfair advantage at Ten.  Warburton said he needed to review the judgment and consider his options before commenting further.  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""in-article4"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article4"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""in-article-4-LL3KD81A74E901""}   “We now have certainty about James’s starting date,” Ten Chairman Brian Long said in a statement. “We are disappointed it has been delayed.”  The case is Seven Network (Operations) Ltd. v.

NFL Players Seek Cash for Owners’ TV Deal During Lockout  National Football League players asked a U.S. judge to award them damages for team owners’ decision to trade their top price for television broadcast rights for $4 billion in payments during a labor lockout.  “The NFL illegally obtained a $4 billion war chest to fund the lockout,” Jeffrey Kessler, a lawyer for the players, told U.S. District Judge David Doty yesterday at a hearing in Minneapolis. “They did so without good faith.”  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article5"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article5"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-5-LL3KD81A74E901""}   Attorneys for the players asked Doty for an order barring the owners from accessing those funds. They’re also seeking as much as $700 million in damages, Kessler’s co-counsel, Thomas J. Heiden, told reporters outside the court.  The hearing comes while the U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis, in a separate case, weighs whether to uphold an order by a federal judge in St. Paul, Minnesota, for the NFL to end the lockout it imposed March 12.  In their labor fight, team owners and players are arguing over the distribution of about $9 billion in league revenue, the most in U.S. sports. The two sides also disagree about extending the regular season by two games, capping rookie pay and paying for players’ health care.  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""in-article5"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article5"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""in-article-5-LL3KD81A74E901""}   Doty ruled March 1 that the 32-team league violated the terms of a settlement agreement, first created in 1993, that obligated the owners to make their best effort to maximize total revenue for the league and its players in 2009 and 2010.  The NFL extended broadcast contracts and altered lockout provisions with DirecTV, CBS Corp., News Corp.’s Fox, Comcast Corp.’s NBC and Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN Inc.  “The NFL renegotiated the broadcast contracts to benefit its exclusive interest at the expense of, and contrary to, the joint interests of the NFL and the players,” Doty said in that ruling. “Broadcast contracts are an enormous source of shared revenue for the players and the NFL.”  Gregg H. Levy, a lawyer for the league, told Doty yesterday that “nobody knew the likelihood of a lockout in 2009,” when the TV deals were being renegotiated.  “There is nothing, zero, in this record that there was a plan or a commitment to have a lockout,” Levy said. “Was there a contingency plan? Yes. Was there a commitment? Certainly no.”  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article6"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article6"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-6-LL3KD81A74E901""}   The TV rights case is White v.

The SEC, attorneys general and U.S. Attorney’s offices “have made inquiries or issued subpoenas concerning our foreign-exchange pricing,” the Boston-based company said in a regulatory filing made public May 9.  The firm has been sued by California and the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System for alleged fraud. The suits claim State Street secretly marked up the price of some foreign-exchange transactions. Those and similar suits against Bank of New York Mellon Corp. have brought scrutiny to currency transactions that could lead to lower revenue across the industry.  “State Street is responding to inquiries from various regulatory bodies regarding its foreign-exchange practices,” Hannah Grove, a spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. “We will cooperate fully with the SEC in its inquiry” and “continue to defend ourselves against any allegations of wrongdoing.”  California said in October 2009 that State Street defrauded the state’s two biggest public pension funds of $56 million since 2001 by charging more than agreed on the transactions and concealing the overcharges by entering false exchange rates into its own databases and in documents. The state is seeking more than $200 million in damages and penalties.

BNP’s Banca Nazionale del Lavoro SpA allegedly committed fraud by misleading the cities on swaps, the finance police said in an e-mailed statement. The assets that were seized represent the alleged hidden fees that BNL charged on the swaps from 2002 through 2007, the police said.  BNL said the Rome-based bank acted properly and that the seizure is unwarranted, according to an e-mailed statement. Misunderstandings are at the basis of the cases, BNL said, adding that it will appeal to overturn the seizure.  Public authorities across Europe tried to cut borrowing costs in recent years through derivatives deals with risks they couldn’t measure.

A Yara employee came forward with information on the project’s operations in 2006 and 2007 and Yara approached Norway’s economic and environmental crime authority, or Oekokrim, the company said yesterday in a statement. Oekokrim started an investigation on evidence that a $1 million payment had been made to a “third party,” according to the statement.  “Regardless of what Oekokrim conclude, these charges are very serious for Yara,” said Chief Executive Officer Joergen Ole Haslestad, who joined Oslo-based Yara as CEO in October  2008. “We are cooperating with Oekokrim and await the results of the investigation.”  The Indian project’s remit, to set up a joint venture to produce and sell fertilizer, was never realized.  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article9"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article9"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-9-LL3KD81A74E901""}   “It is, of course, very difficult to estimate the potential impact on Yara from this, but my best guess would be that the final impact should be minor on the numbers side,” Tomas Skeivys, a Vilnius, Lithuania-based analyst at Terra Markets, said. “Still, the negative sentiment and a bit of a reputation destruction might weigh on Yara due to this.”  For the latest new suits news, click here.

The deadline for including Morgan Crucible in the lawsuit, which seeks as much as 129 million pounds ($209.5 million), expired sooner than for other cartel members because it didn’t join their challenge to an earlier European Union fine, the company’s lawyers said yesterday at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London. The railway companies rejected the argument, saying all of the cartel members are jointly liable for losses.  “It’s clear that liability is joint” and losses “can be recovered from any of the cartelists,” the group’s lawyer, Jon Turner of Monckton Chambers in London, said at the hearing. Morgan Crucible’s “participation sustained the cartel,” he said.  The price-fixing, which lasted from 1988 to 1999, caused customers to pay too much for graphite-based goods used for transferring electricity in train motors, the rail companies claimed. While Windsor, England-based Morgan Crucible won immunity from EU fines by being the first to cooperate, its former Chief Executive Officer Ian Norris was sentenced to 18 months in prison in a parallel U.S. case.  European Union regulators in 2003 levied fines totaling 101 million euros against four of the cartel’s five members, SGL Carbon SE, France’s Carbone Lorraine SA, Austria’s Hoffmann & Co. and Schunk GmbH. The railway companies’ lawyers have said the case, filed in December, may be the most significant claim of its kind in Europe.  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article10"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article10"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-10-LL3KD81A74E901""}   The case is Deutsche Bahn AG & Others v.

Officials of New York-based Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday that the reserve provides “the minimum expected costs to resolve all of the other outstanding” lawsuits over its hormone-replacement drugs. The company didn’t say how many cases would be settled.  “I see this as an effort to clean up a long-standing litigation so they can go forward with their business plan,” Les Funtleyder, a New York-based fund manager at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York who holds Pfizer shares, said in a phone interview. “This is probably a good thing for the stock.”  More than 6 million women took Prempro and related menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth’s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market, exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women’s Health Initiative, a study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.  The company’s announcement that it had resolved a third of the cases over its menopause drugs means Pfizer has settled more than 3,300 cases.  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article11"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article11"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-11-LL3KD81A74E901""}   “The decision to settle cases reflects a business decision by the company to avoid the cost and distraction of prolonged litigation,” Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  “We are pleased to see Pfizer finally accept responsibility for the injuries this drug caused to women and hope the company will compensate each woman fairly and reasonably,” Zoe Littlepage, a Houston-based lawyer who serves as lead counsel for ex-Prempro users in the consolidated Arkansas cases, said in a phone interview.

Warner Music, Sony Reach $105 Million Agreement With Lime Wire  Warner Music Group Corp. and Sony Corp., along with other music labels, agreed during a trial to settle their copyright lawsuit against Lime Wire LLC and its founder, Mark Gorton, for $105 million.  “The case has just settled,” U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood told jurors yesterday.  Lawyers for both sides met throughout the day at the Manhattan courthouse. The defendants will pay a total of $105 million, according to e-mailed statements from the Recording Industry Association of America and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, the law firm representing Lime Wire and Gorton.  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article12"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article12"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-12-LL3KD81A74E901""}   During the trial, the music-label owners, which also included Vivendi SA’s Universal Music Group and Citigroup Inc.’s EMI Group, sought more than $1 billion. The labels claimed Lime Wire and Gorton induced the infringement of copyrights on thousands of songs through peer-to-peer file-sharing software on the Internet. Wood ordered Lime Wire to shut down its music service last year.  Glenn Pomerantz, a lawyer for the music companies, told the jury of eight women and one man in opening statements on May 3 that the record industry’s revenue fell 52 percent from 2000, the year Lime Wire was founded, to 2010.  “We are pleased to have reached a large monetary settlement,” the recording association said in its statement. “Designing and operating services to profit from the theft of the world’s greatest music comes with a stiff price.”  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""in-article12"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article12"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""in-article-12-LL3KD81A74E901""}   Gorton, 44, declined to comment about the settlement.

Bayou Group Estate Wins $13 Million Recovery From Hedge Funds  The estate of hedge-fund firm Bayou Group LLC, which turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, won a jury verdict requiring hedge funds that redeemed their money before Bayou collapsed to pay investors $13 million, a lawyer said.  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article13"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article13"",""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-13-LL3KD81A74E901""}   Yesterday’s victory in federal court in Manhattan follows the estate’s previous recovery of $5.4 million in “fictitious profits,” bringing the total recouped to more than $60 million, said Gary Mennitt, a lawyer representing the estate for the benefit of its investors.   The estate sued to recover the amounts withdrawn by hedge funds Redwood Growth Partners and Heritage Hedged Equity, investment company D. Canale & Co., two trusts and an endowment fund, Mennitt said in a phone interview. The jury found the funds failed to prove that they had, in good faith, conducted a diligent investigation of the Bayou fraud before withdrawing their principal investment, he said.  “This is first time that a Ponzi scheme estate has been successful at trial in defeating an investor’s good-faith defense and thus recovering the full principal, or amount paid to the redeeming investor,” the lawyer said.  {""contentId"":""LL3KD81A74E901"",""position"":""in-article13"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article13"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2011-05-13/primary-global-murdoch-yara-morgan-crucible-in-court-news""},""containerId"":""in-article-13-LL3KD81A74E901""}   David Baum, a lawyer representing the defendant hedge funds, said in a phone interview he was disappointed by the verdict and that the funds will appeal.  In 2009, Samuel Israel, the convicted founder of Bayou Group LLC, was sentenced to two additional years in prison for faking his suicide and running away the day he was to begin a 20-year term for a $400 million fraud.  Israel founded Bayou in 1995 with James Marquez. After the company lost money in 1998, Marquez and finance chief Daniel Marino created a sham accounting firm to serve as the company’s external auditor, Israel admitted. Rather than disclose modest losses, Bayou reported profits, Israel said. Bayou filed for bankruptcy in May 2006.  The estate recovery case is In Re Bayou Group, LLC, 09-2313, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The Bayou fraud case is U.S. v. Israel, 1:05-cr-01039, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  For the latest verdict and settlement news, click here.
