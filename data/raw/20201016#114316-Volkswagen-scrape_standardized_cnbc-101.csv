The turnaround plan announced on Friday will lead to 3.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in annual savings by 2020 and lift the Volkswagen brand’s operating margin to 4 percent that year, from an expected 2 percent in 2016.     That target still remains below rival European carmakers such as Renault and Peugeot Citroen which is targeting an operating margin of 6 percent in 2021. "
