He instead proposed an indirect holding via Germany's KfW development bank. Lufthansa declined to comment.CEO Carsten Spohr had told employees at the weekend that shareholders representing less than 38% of shares had registered to vote, handing Thiele a virtual veto on the bailout, which needs two-thirds of votes to pass.The group said last week that a ""no"" vote would force it to seek protection from creditors. That could eventually lead to break-up pressures on the group, whose other carriers include Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Swiss.Scholz, who met Thiele on Monday along with Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, has refused to countenance changes to the complex deal.($1 = 0.8884 euros)(Additional reporting by Christian Kraemer, Michelle Martin and Joern Polz; Writing by Arno Schuetze and Laurence Frost; Editing by Thomas Seythal and Mark Potter)"
