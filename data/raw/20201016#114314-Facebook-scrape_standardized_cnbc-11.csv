However, none of that ad spending has been on Twitter. Instead, it’s taking place exclusively on rival social media site Facebook.Defeat by Tweet is far from alone. Scores of political candidates and outside groups have loaded up on Facebook spending ahead of next month’s election. That’s partly because Facebook reaches over a quarter-billion users in North America every month and has a family of popular apps, including Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. But it’s also because many other ad-supported sites have retreated from politics, leaving Facebook as the only game in town. Google, the largest internet advertising company, limited the ability for campaigns to target users with political ads. Twitter banned political advertising altogether after CEO Jack Dorsey proclaimed last October that “political message reach should be earned, not bought.” TikTok also forbids political ads, and Snap has promised to fact-check them.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, has been steadfast in his refusal to put fact-checking measures in place, arguing that they could interfere with free speech. Facebook also allows political advertisers to use the same kind of targeting tools as corporate advertisers, giving them precise tools to reach relevant voters and potential donors.Facebook’s most dramatic move came last month, when the company said it will stop showing new political ads in the seven days before voters head to the polls on Nov. 3 to choose between President Donald Trump and Joe Biden.Nick Fitz, CEO of online donations company Momentum, which powers Defeat by Tweet, says digital campaigns now rely almost entirely on Facebook, regardless of how the people running them feel about the platform.“For better or worse — mostly worse — Facebook is the de facto place you go,” Fitz said. “It’s the cheapest and most effective way to get in front of the right people.”Adding up money shelled out for the presidential contest, the congressional and gubernatorial races and from third-party groups advocating for candidates and causes, political advertisers in the U.S. spent at least $264 million on Facebook in the third quarter, according to CNBC’s compilation of data from the Center for Responsive Politics and Facebook’s ad library. That comes to about 3% of Facebook’s estimated total U.S. revenue in the third quarter. Zuckerberg said last October that ads from politicians (not including third-party campaigns) would account for 0.5% of Facebook’s revenue in 2020.
