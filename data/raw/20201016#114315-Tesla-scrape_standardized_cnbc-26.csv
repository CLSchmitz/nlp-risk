List 3 went into effect on 2018 and currently places 25% duties on $200 billion of imported goods from China. List 4 went into effect in 2019 and currently consists of a 7.5% tariff on $120 billion of Chinese imports. Both lists contain hundreds of very specific items, ranging from raw materials to electronic components. The lawsuit did not describe which items Tesla paid tariffs on, nor how much it paid. Tesla and the U.S. trade representative didn’t immediately return requests for comment. The U.S. trade representative’s “imposition of List 3 and List 4 duties was arbitrary and capricious because USTR did not provide meaningful opportunity to comment, failed to consider relevant factors when making its decision, and failed to draw a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made,” Tesla’s lawyers argued in Wednesday’s filing, which also named the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan, as a defendant.
