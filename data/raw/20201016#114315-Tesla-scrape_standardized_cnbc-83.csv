Its sale of pollution credits accounts for its margin of profitability, aided by curtailed capital spending.While its index inclusion came to be seen as a forgone conclusion — and, ultimately, it might be inevitable — this was always an overhyped element of the bull case for the stock, as I detailed back in July.Tesla shares cratered 15% in premarket trading Tuesday, the first trading day since the S&P snub.S&P Dow Jones Indices doesn’t explain its rationale for not adding a company, simply announcing the new entrants and those dropped — in this case, Etsy, Teledyne and Catalent in place of H&R Block, Coty and Kohl’s.
