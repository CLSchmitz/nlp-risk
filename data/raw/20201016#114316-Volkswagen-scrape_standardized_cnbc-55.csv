Sales executive Bram Schot is acting as interim replacement.Both VW and Audi have said that Stadler is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise.“Mr. Stadler is (leaving) because, due to his ongoing pre-trial detention, he is unable to fulfil his duties as a member of the board of management and wishes to concentrate on his defense,” Volkswagen said in its statement on Tuesday.
