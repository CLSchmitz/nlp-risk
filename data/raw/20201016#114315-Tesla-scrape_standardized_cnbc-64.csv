The F-150 and its larger siblings, collectively known as Ford’s F-Series, have been America’s bestselling pickups for 43 years and the nation’s top-selling vehicle for 38 years.“We have a very substantial amount of brand equity in the ‘Built Ford Tough’ F-150 both in terms of design language, capability and the name itself,” he said.
