Klein added that SAP has attracted customers at the five-day meeting of the world’s elite, which are asking it to “lead us into the next chapter.”The German tech giant was the subject of criticism from some customers over a decision to end support for software running on third-party databases like Oracle. Late last year, Oracle’s technology chief Larry Ellison fired criticism of his own at the firm, claiming SAP’s customer base was “up for grabs.”In Oracle’s second-quarter earnings call, Ellison said one of SAP’s biggest customers would go live on Oracle’s enterprise resource planning platform (ERP)  in 2020. ERP is a piece of software used by firms to manage their business and automate back office functions.
