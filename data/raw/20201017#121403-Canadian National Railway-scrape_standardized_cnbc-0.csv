That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak.Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far.“The combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients.
