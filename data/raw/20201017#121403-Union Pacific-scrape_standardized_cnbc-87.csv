The settlement, confirmed in a joint statement by the two sides,  was reached three days after U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez  arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday to broker a deal with the  help of a federal mediator who had joined in the talks six weeks  earlier.   The White House called the deal “a huge relief” for the economy,  businesses and workers.    President Barack Obama urged the parties “to work together to  clear out the backlogs and congestion in the West Coast ports as  they finalize their agreement,” the White House said in a  statement.   The 20,000 dockworkers covered by the tentative five-year labor  accord have been without a contract since July.   Tensions arising from the talks have played out since last fall  in chronic cargo backups that have increasingly slowed freight  traffic at the ports, which handle nearly half of all U.S.  maritime trade and more than 70 percent of the nation’s imports  from Asia.

Perez said that as part of Friday’s accord, the International  Longshore and Warehouse Union and the shippers’ bargaining agent,  the Pacific Maritime Association, agreed to fully restore all  port operations starting Saturday evening.   Perez was sent to California on Tuesday as an emissary for Obama,  who had come under mounting political pressure to intervene in a  conflict that by some estimates could have ended up costing the  U.S. economy billions of dollars.   Almost summoned to Washington?       Perez said he told the union and management negotiators: “You  have an obligation to resolve this matter quickly because too  many people and businesses are suffering.”    In a conference call with reporters following the agreement,  Perez said he also had put leaders from both sides on notice that  unless they came to terms swiftly they would be “summoned to  Washington to continue their negotiations at the White  House.” "
