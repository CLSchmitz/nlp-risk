The company has also previously announced that it will not allow any ads that seek to delegitimize the results of the election. Facebook’s policy change comes as President Donald Trump has used social media to make false claims that voting by mail leads to election fraud. Trump has also refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose. The move comes despite Facebook saying on Sept. 3 that it would not announce any more policy changes related to the election between then and the official election results.Additionally, Facebook on Wednesday announced that it will “remove calls for people to engage in poll watching when those calls use militarized language or suggest that the goal is to intimidate, exert control, or display power over election officials or voters.”This would include words such as “army” or “battle,” said Monika Bickert, Facebook’s vice president of content policy.This change comes after Trump called on supporters “to go into the polls and watch very carefully” during last week’s presidential debate.Facebook also announced that if the declared winner of a race is contested by another candidate, the social network will show users the declared winner’s name and a link to more information in the company’s Voting Information Center. Facebook had previously announced that if a candidate or political party attempted to prematurely declare victory it would notify users that counting is still in progress.Over the past year, Facebook has been widely criticized for its decision to allow politicians to include misinformation in their ads while others in the social media market, such as Twitter and TikTok, have banned political ads altogether.
