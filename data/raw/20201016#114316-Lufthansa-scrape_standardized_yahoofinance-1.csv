We are happy if we can reach 20% during winter,"" he added.Lufthansa, which in June received a 9 billion euro government bailout, last month announced further cuts to its fleet and workforce along with a 1.1 billion euro impairment on idled aircraft.Spohr added on Monday he was certain the group would weather the crisis.(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Writing by Ludwig Burger and Mark Potter)"
