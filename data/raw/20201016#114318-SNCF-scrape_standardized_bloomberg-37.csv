The work involves about 1,300 platforms corresponding to 15 percent of the total, according to a statement from SNCF, which will take delivery of the new trains from Alstom SA of France and Canada’s Bombardier Inc. through 2016.    {""contentId"":""N5XDVL6K50ZX01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-05-21/french-rail-to-shrink-platforms-for-new-too-wide-trains""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-N5XDVL6K50ZX01""}   {""contentId"":""N5XDVL6K50ZX01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-05-21/french-rail-to-shrink-platforms-for-new-too-wide-trains""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-N5XDVL6K50ZX01""}   While the government and opposition leaders criticized what they said was a waste of money, SNCF said the expense is equal to only 1.5 percent of the 3 billion-euro cost of the regional expresses and that similar work had to be done in 2003 and 2005 with the introduction of other models new to the network.    {""contentId"":""N5XDVL6K50ZX01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2014-05-21/french-rail-to-shrink-platforms-for-new-too-wide-trains""},""containerId"":""box-31qz1V7""}   “Each time new rolling stock arrives the infrastructure must be adapted, given that platforms are on average 150 years old,” said SNCF, as Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais is known. “The price of tickets will not go up.”    SNCF, which manages rolling stock and station facilities, and RFF, which oversees the tracks, were separated in 1997. Parliament will debate a proposed law next month that would bring the two entities under a single holding company.  {""contentId"":""N5XDVL6K50ZX01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2014-05-21/french-rail-to-shrink-platforms-for-new-too-wide-trains""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-N5XDVL6K50ZX01""}   “This spending is perfectly useful and necessary, unless we want smaller and less comfortable trains,” RFF President Jacques Rapoport said on Europe1 radio.  Energy and Environment Minister Segolene Royal, whose ministry is responsible for transport, called the situation “disconcerting” and “stupid.” Marine Le Pen, the head of the National Front, which is challenging for first place in the May 25 European Parliament elections, said it was “an unacceptable waste of public money.”   Published on ‎21‎ ‎May‎, ‎2014‎ ‎16‎:‎10        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
