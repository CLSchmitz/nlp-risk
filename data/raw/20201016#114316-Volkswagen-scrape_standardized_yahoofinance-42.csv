He said such vehicles are garnering market shares in Europe and Germany as well. Why It Matters: The ID.4 is already in production in Germany. It will be made in the United States, beginning 2022, at Chattanooga, Tennessee.Volkswagen claims the vehicle can cover a range of nearly 310 miles (500 kms).The company's production targets, as shared by Brandstätter are significantly above the current EV production levels. For context, it took industry leader Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) 12 years from launching its first consumer car to manufacture 1 million EV units. In 2019, the Palo Alto-based company reported about 367,500 unit deliveries overall. Tesla CEO Elon Musk got a preview of the ID range this month when he took an ID.3 vehicle for a test drive during his meeting with Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess.“I think, for a non-sporty car, it’s pretty good,” Musk retorted while driving the vehicle.Story continuesPrice Action: Volkswagen OTC shares closed 0.35% lower at $18.42 on Thursday.Photo courtesy: Volkswagen AGSee more from BenzingaWhat Elon Musk Thinks Of Bill Gates' Knowledge About Electric VehiclesTesla Model Y A 'Thought Through' Car, Volkswagen CEO Showers Praise After Test DriveBill Gates Thinks All-Electric Pickups Aren't A 'Practical Solution'© 2020 Benzinga.com.
