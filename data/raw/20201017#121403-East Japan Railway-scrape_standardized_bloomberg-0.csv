The younger Trump flew on Air Force One to last week’s debate in Cleveland with President Donald Trump; first lady Melania Trump; spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany; Hope Hicks, a top White House adviser; Nicholas Luna, Trump’s personal assistant, and campaign manager Bill Stepien; all of whom later were found to have contracted the virus. He stayed home from last Friday until Tuesday, the person said.    {""contentId"":""QHYGBAT0AFB601"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-09/donald-trump-jr-to-hit-campaign-trail-after-covid-quarantine""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QHYGBAT0AFB601""}   {""contentId"":""QHYGBAT0AFB601"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-09/donald-trump-jr-to-hit-campaign-trail-after-covid-quarantine""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QHYGBAT0AFB601""}   He has since tested negative three times, according to the person, who was granted anonymity to discuss his schedule.    {""contentId"":""QHYGBAT0AFB601"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-09/donald-trump-jr-to-hit-campaign-trail-after-covid-quarantine""},""containerId"":""box-KDTLU2H""}   Among the events is a bus tour in Florida where the president’s eldest son will be joined by the mixed martial arts fighter Jorge Masvidal and Max Alvarez, the Cuban-American businessman who gave a speech at the Republican National Convention.
