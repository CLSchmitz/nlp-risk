Audi and FAW on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding to start a company that will produce electric cars for the Chinese market from 2024, Audi said in a statement. The new cars will be designed to meet the requirements of local premium buyers and use the PPE electric platform developed with Porsche, Audi said.    {""contentId"":""QI4VKYDWRGGE01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-13/audi-to-build-electric-cars-geared-to-chinese-buyers-from-2024""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QI4VKYDWRGGE01""}   {""contentId"":""QI4VKYDWRGGE01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-13/audi-to-build-electric-cars-geared-to-chinese-buyers-from-2024""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QI4VKYDWRGGE01""}   “This decision emphasizes the strategic importance of the Chinese market,” Chief Executive Officer Markus Duesmann said. The companies signed the agreement during a German-Chinese car conference in Changchun.    {""contentId"":""QI4VKYDWRGGE01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-13/audi-to-build-electric-cars-geared-to-chinese-buyers-from-2024""},""containerId"":""box-MZlTE0P""}   After entering the country in the late 1980s with FAW and building an early lead, Audi sales rose and the brand became the quasi-official ride of high-ranking government officials and privileged businessmen. Yet in recent years, Audi has seen rising competition from Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz and BMW AG, which have won over buyers with new designs.    China’s government has poured upwards of $30 billion into nurturing its electric-vehicle industry, building the world’s largest market for battery-powered cars. Higher subsidies in several countries in Europe have spurred sales there, meaning the region looks increasingly likely to outpace China soon, according to a report by research firm Jato Dynamics.  {""contentId"":""QI4VKYDWRGGE01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-13/audi-to-build-electric-cars-geared-to-chinese-buyers-from-2024""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QI4VKYDWRGGE01""}   Audi’s deliveries in China rose 4.5% to 512,081 vehicles in the first nine months of this year, the best result in its 30-year history in the country. Audi plans to generate about 40% of its unit sales in China with electrified cars by 2025.   Published on ‎13‎ ‎October‎, ‎2020‎ ‎12‎:‎23        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
