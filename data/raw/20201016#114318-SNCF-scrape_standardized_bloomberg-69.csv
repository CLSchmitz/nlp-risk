The protest against President Nicolas Sarkozy's plan to roll back pension privileges is due to widen next week when teachers and civil servants are set to walkout in opposition to his efforts to deregulate labor and services markets.    {""contentId"":""JRG1R30YHQ0X01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2007-11-13/french-strike-starts-tonight-to-protest-sarkozy-s-pension-plan""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-JRG1R30YHQ0X01""}   {""contentId"":""JRG1R30YHQ0X01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2007-11-13/french-strike-starts-tonight-to-protest-sarkozy-s-pension-plan""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-JRG1R30YHQ0X01""}   Public-service unions oppose measures aimed at bringing transport and energy workers' pension systems in line with others. The plan seeks to ensure that they work 40 years instead of 37.5 to earn a full pension. Seven unions called for a strike of unlimited duration at RATP, operator of Paris's metros, buses and tramways.    {""contentId"":""JRG1R30YHQ0X01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2007-11-13/french-strike-starts-tonight-to-protest-sarkozy-s-pension-plan""},""containerId"":""box-WhADUky""}   ``We want to keep this strike as short as possible,'' Christian Mahieux, a union leader at SNCF, the national rail company, told Europe 1 radio today. ``The government has no other choice but to give in.''    Labor Minister Xavier Bertrand is planning a meeting with Bernard Thibault, the head of Confederation Generale du Travail, the nation's second-biggest union, later today. A 2003 pension reform ``is already the rule for 25 million workers,'' Bertrand told Le Parisien newspaper yesterday. ``How could we tell them that 500,000 of their fellow workers can escape it?''  Not Popular  Most French people oppose the strike, two polls published today by Les Echos daily and Metro, a free newspaper, showed.  {""contentId"":""JRG1R30YHQ0X01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2007-11-13/french-strike-starts-tonight-to-protest-sarkozy-s-pension-plan""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-JRG1R30YHQ0X01""}   Sixty-two percent of the respondents to an Ifop institute poll for Metro said they thought the strike ``was not justified.'' In the BVA-Les Echos survey, the level of opposition increased to 55 percent, two points more than last month when transport workers went on strike.  ``French people expect more equity in the pension system and they clearly don't support this strike,'' said Jerome Fourquet, deputy director of public opinion studies at Ifop, a Paris-based polling company. ``Sarkozy has the general public's support and the political legitimacy to hold onto his reforms. The only risk is for this strike to last too long.''  {""contentId"":""JRG1R30YHQ0X01"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2007-11-13/french-strike-starts-tonight-to-protest-sarkozy-s-pension-plan""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-JRG1R30YHQ0X01""}   In some of the biggest strikes that brought French transport to a standstill in 1995 for about three weeks, unions rallied a 50 percent support at least, Fourquet said.  Disruptions  All but one union at SNCF will begin strikes at 8 p.m. French time tonight. Public workers at Electricite de France SA and Gaz de France SA utilities will start cutting output tonight. The Paris Opera may cancel the premiere of Tchaikovsky's ``Nutcracker'' tomorrow night. The Comedie Francaise, the national theater, is scrapping its Nov. 14 performance and may cancel more if the strike expands.  Eurostar Group, which runs high-speed trains from the U.K. to continental Europe, said the strikes won't stop the first day of service from London's refurbished St. Pancras rail station. No trains have been canceled between tonight and tomorrow, Gareth Headon, a spokesman for the London-based rail operator, said over the telephone. The company doesn't expect delays or cancellations, he said.  Thalys, the Franco-German-Belgian railway company that runs high-speed train in Northern Europe, said 10 of the 50 trains between Paris and Brussels will be canceled and others may be delayed about 30 minutes. Lines to Amsterdam, Koln and Rotterdam will suffer delays.  ``We believe the disruption will continue through the 15th and almost certainly the 16th of November,'' the Brussels-based company's spokeswoman Patricia Baars said over the phone.  More Strikes  {""contentId"":""JRG1R30YHQ0X01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""url"":""/news/articles/2007-11-13/french-strike-starts-tonight-to-protest-sarkozy-s-pension-plan""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-2-JRG1R30YHQ0X01""}   SNCF said in a statement only 90 out of its 700 high-speed TGV trains will run tomorrow. The operator advised passengers ``to limit their journeys,'' and said train services will be ``highly disrupted'' until Nov. 18.  Only one out of every 10 metro trains will run in Paris, with no service to Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport and virtually none to Orly airport. The last strike cost SNCF 50 million euros ($73 million), it said. A strike can cost 20 million euros a day, including disruptions in the freight service, the company said.  {""contentId"":""JRG1R30YHQ0X01"",""position"":""in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article2"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2007-11-13/french-strike-starts-tonight-to-protest-sarkozy-s-pension-plan""},""containerId"":""in-article-2-JRG1R30YHQ0X01""}   ``The reform the government decided is unavoidable,'' Anne-Marie Idrac, president of the SNCF told RTL radio today. She wrote to all 160,000 employees of the railroad to outline the latest proposals, which include pay increases for those working beyond 55 years, the SNCF's current retirement age.  Electricite de France's workers plan to start power cuts as soon as 9 p.m. Paris time tonight, Maurice Marion, a spokesman for the CGT union, said over the telephone. He did not give further details.  Velib', the free bicycle service operated by JCDecaux SA in Paris, expects to almost double rentals tomorrow, said a spokeswoman who declined to be identified. During the last strike on Oct. 18, Parisians used 180,000 Velib's to get around.  Civil servants, teachers and other public workers have called for a strike on Nov. 20 and judiciary employees plan a Nov. 29 walkout.
