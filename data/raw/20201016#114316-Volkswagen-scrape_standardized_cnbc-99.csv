Last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Volkswagen has been cheating on American air pollution  tests in diesel vehicles issued between 2008 and 2015, which  the company later admitted. The Justice Department later filed a  civil complaint against it.  The carmaker agreed to pay $16.5 billion in civil litigation  fines in the U.S. Now, the U.S. government and Volkswagen are  trying to reach a settlement by January, Bloomberg reported,  citing two people familiar with the negotiations.  The sources said its not clear what the penalty range the  government is considering but it is possible the Justice  Department may asses the impact of a charge on the business’s  “viability.”  Read the  full Bloomberg report here.  Volkswagen’s U.S. stock is down about 10 percent so far this year.  Neither Volkswagen nor the Justice Department immediately responded to CNBC’s requests for comment.
