Oliver Schmidt, who led Volkswagen’s regulatory compliance office  in the United States from 2014 to March 2015, was arrested  on Saturday by investigators in Florida and is expected to be  arraigned on Monday in Detroit, said the two people, a law  enforcement official and someone familiar with the case.  Lawyers representing Mr. Schmidt did not respond to requests for  comment late Sunday. Officials at the Justice Department also  declined to comment, as did an F.B.I. spokesman in Detroit.
