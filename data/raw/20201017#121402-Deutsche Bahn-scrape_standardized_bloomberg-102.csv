The EVG railway workers’ union is planning to strike from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. to increase pressure in a pay dispute, and could continue to cause disruption “for hours” after that, Deutsche Bahn AG said in a statement Sunday. The railway operator added that it will try to minimize the impact of strikes on its customers.     Published on ‎9‎ ‎December‎, ‎2018‎ ‎17‎:‎45        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
