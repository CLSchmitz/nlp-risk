If you’re trying to assign valuation on Tesla based on the conventional automobile industry, of course the stock is going to look expensive,” Gordon said. “We don’t see Tesla as an auto company but more as a ‘technology on wheels’ kind of company.”Traditional automakers General Motors and Ford trade at eight and 27 times forward earnings, respectively. By comparison, Tesla trades with a 129 times multiple — far higher than the Ford and GM but more in line with some of the high-flying momentum stocks such as Amazon.Even after a nearly 300% rally in 2020, Gordon says the stock’s technical setup suggests limited further downside.“If you look at the chart, coming from early 2020 at the March low, we actually have a nice uptrend channel here that has begun to offer support around the $355 level,” said Gordon. “Tesla has really just pulled back, and we might be looking at support here. If this line is broken, not all hope is lost. You do have support down here at about the $280 level as well.”Tesla closed at $330.21 on Tuesday. A move to $280 implies roughly 15% downside.
