For the first eight months of the year, Volkswagen’s deliveries are still down 21.5%.Volkswagen’s Traton trucks unit is in the middle of both a major restructuring at its MAN unit and an attempt to acquire Navistar International Corp., and recently sweetened its offer for its U.S. rival to $3.6 billion.In his comments Wednesday, Diess called the possible takeover an “important step,” suggesting VW is determined to push the deal through.At the shareholder’s meeting, Diess is trying to convince investors that the electric offensive he’s started will help the company compete with the likes of Tesla Inc.Shareholders, by contrast, will focus their questions on other matters, notably a criminal trial taking place on the same day. Prosecutors on Wednesday will begin presenting their cases against former Audi chief Rupert Stadler and other officials for alleged roles in the dieselgate scandal.(Updates with Diess comments on Navistar bid)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.
