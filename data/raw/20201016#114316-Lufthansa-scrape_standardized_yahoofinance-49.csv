Services union Verdi said on Monday that further talks had been scheduled for Friday. Lufthansa said that showed Verdi was not prepared to come to an agreement before the shareholder meeting.Shares, which had fallen 3.8% in Monday's session, were down by 1% at 1045 GMT.($1 = 0.8862 euros)(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach and Vera Eckert, editing by Michelle Martin and Kirsten Donovan)
