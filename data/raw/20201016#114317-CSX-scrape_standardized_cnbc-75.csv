However, revenue was below forecasts as the key  metric of revenue per available seat mile fell 5.6 percent from a  year earlier. Delta also said an August outage cost the  airline $100 million.  Wells  Fargo — Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf  announced his retirement, effective immediately, following the  sales practices scandal that’s engulfed the bank over the past  few weeks. Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan will succeed Stumpf  as CEO, while lead director Stephen Sanger will take the  chairman’s slot.  Pfizer — Jefferies downgraded the drugmaker to “hold” from “buy,” due to a lack of catalysts and  drivers for a higher stock price. The firm said AbbVie and Eli Lilly remain its top U.S. picks in the drug sector. Separately, Pfizer lost its appeal in a  patent case over its pain drug Lyrica in a U.K. court, but said it  would seek a further appeal.  CSX — CSX reported quarterly profit of 48  cents per share, three cents a share above estimates. Revenue for  the railroad operator was slightly ahead of forecasts. CSX’s  results were hurt by a drop in freight volumes, but did manage to  beat expectations nonetheless.  Kellogg — The cereal maker bought Ritmo  Investimentos, the controlling shareholder of Brazilian food  company Parati. Kellogg also said it would cut back on stock  buybacks this year to “preserve financial flexibility.”  Harley-Davidson — The motorcycle maker is  planning to increase its emphasis on Asian sales, according to  Chief Executive Officer Matthew Levatich. He told Reuters he is  optimistic about growing the company’s business in both existing  and new Asian markets.  Nokia — The wireless technology company  was removed from the “Conviction Buy” list at Goldman Sachs,  although the firm retained a “buy” rating. Goldman said the move  reflects further declines in global capital expenditures by the  wireless industry.  Dollar  Tree, Five Below — The two stocks were both  rated “overweight” in a new report on discount retailers at  KeyBanc, which also rated Dollar General at “sector  weight.” Keybanc said Dollar Tree is executing well at its legacy  stores, as well as successfully turning around the Family Dollar  stores it acquired when it bought that company last year.   Five Below got praise for good product value, as well as an  “exciting shopping experience.”  HCA — HCA was upgraded to  “overweight” from “sector weight” at KeyBanc, which pointed to  both valuation of the hospital operator’s stock and a potential  upside catalyst of a more likely Hillary Clinton win in the  presidential election.    Amazon.com — Amazon announced it  would hire more than 120,000 seasonal workers for this y year’s  holiday season. The online retailer noted that more than 14,000  of last year’s seasonal hires stayed on as full-time employees.  Abercrombie & Fitch — The apparel  retailer announced a redefined identity for the Abercrombie &  Fitch brand, to be accompanied by its largest-ever ad campaign.  It will feature a redesigned website and all new digital  advertising.
