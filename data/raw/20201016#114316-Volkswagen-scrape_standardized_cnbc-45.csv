The CFO stressed this was critical if the company aimed to compete in a fast-evolving auto market.“We have for the longest time been rightly criticized for overspending,” Witter said, confirming guidance for capital expenditure and R&D, each in the range of 6.5 to 7 percent. “We rightly prepare to market for an uplift this year in order to be ready for CO2 compliance by 2020 but also for the continued electrification and digitization of our offering, which is critical to meet those targets.”
