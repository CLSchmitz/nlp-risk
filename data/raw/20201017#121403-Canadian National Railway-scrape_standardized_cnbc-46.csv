But for grain farmers and grain elevator operators in states like  Minnesota and the Dakotas, it’s a near disastrous crisis that  could continue to cost them tens of millions of dollars.  The reason: A lack of available railroad service—from rail  cars to track lines—to ship the grain to market.   While there are various explanations for the  difficulties—from severe weather to the enormity of the  grain harvest—some suspicion lies with the increase in oil  and gas rail shipments at the expense of commodities.  “In 2009, there were 11,000 rail carloads of crude oil but in  2013 there were 400,000 carloads,” said Mike Steenhoek, executive  director of the Soybean Transportation Coalition.  “It’s not all their fault and railroads say they’re not favoring  oil deliveries but I would like to see that argument  substantiated,” he said.   For their part, railroads contend they’re doing all they can to  improve the situation, no matter the customer.

Trevino admitted that BNSF is behind on some commodity rail  deliveries but is doing all it can to catch up.   “We will have more grain shuttles this year than last year and  deploy as much capacity as we can for this fall’s harvest,” he  said.
