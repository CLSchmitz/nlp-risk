Railway workers at Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais plan to down tools at 8 p.m. local time, cutting high- speed train services to and from Paris by 50 percent and those to the rest of France by as much as two-thirds, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.    {""contentId"":""L4GVB10D9L3501"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-06-23/french-strike-over-pensions-reform-starts-to-disrupt-rail-air-services""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-L4GVB10D9L3501""}   {""contentId"":""L4GVB10D9L3501"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-06-23/french-strike-over-pensions-reform-starts-to-disrupt-rail-air-services""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-L4GVB10D9L3501""}   Two out of three Thalys trains to Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands will run normally and the Eurostar service won’t be affected, the SNCF said.    {""contentId"":""L4GVB10D9L3501"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2010-06-23/french-strike-over-pensions-reform-starts-to-disrupt-rail-air-services""},""containerId"":""box-OlZcHxT""}   France’s civil aviation authority has asked carriers to reduce flights by 15 percent tomorrow between 7 a.m. and 2 p.m. at Roissy Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports. Air France will operate all its long-haul flights and an 85 percent domestic and medium-haul service.    This is the second day of action over the pension overhaul, following a May 27 protest that had only a limited impact. Workers plan to walk off the job at Air France-KLM Group SA, France Telecom SA, Airbus SAS, Electricite de France SA, GDF Suez SA, Bouygues Telecom, Renault SA, schools, post offices, ports, hospitals, national radio and television.  {""contentId"":""L4GVB10D9L3501"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-06-23/french-strike-over-pensions-reform-starts-to-disrupt-rail-air-services""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-L4GVB10D9L3501""}   The goal for the unions is to muster enough public support to block the plan, which represents French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s main push to improve public finances in 2010. While strikes have toppled previous attempts at reform, notably in 1995, an Ifop poll published in today’s Le Figaro newspaper showed 58 percent of voters approve the overhaul.  Sarkozy will raise the retirement age to 62 by 2018, from 60 currently, and increase taxes to stem losses in the pension system. French lawmakers will debate the bill in September. The CGT, CFDT, CFTC, FSU, UNSA, Sud and Solidaires unions called for the strike, while Force Ouvriere, the country’s third biggest union, did not.
