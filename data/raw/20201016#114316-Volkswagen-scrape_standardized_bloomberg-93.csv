Northvolt, set up by two former Tesla Inc. executives, has assembled more than $3 billion in debt and equity to finance production in its native Sweden, targeting battery-cell output equal to about 40 gigawatt-hours of capacity.    {""contentId"":""QF7EIHT0AFB901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-17/northvolt-gets-german-loan-guarantee-to-build-battery-cell-plant""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QF7EIHT0AFB901""}   {""contentId"":""QF7EIHT0AFB901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-17/northvolt-gets-german-loan-guarantee-to-build-battery-cell-plant""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QF7EIHT0AFB901""}     Explore dynamic updates of the earth’s key data points       Open the Data Dash     Close              $69.​9B    Renewable power investment worldwide in Q2 2020     34%   Carbon-free net power in Germany, most recent data          0   6   5   4   3   2    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   4   3   2   1   0   .   0   0   9   8   7   6    0   2   1   0   9   8    0   4   3   2   1   0    0   8   7   6   5   4    0   2   1   0   9   8    0   3   2   1   0   9     Parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere          0   4   3   2   1   0   ,   0   0   9   8   7   6    0   6   5   4   3   2    0   7   6   5   4   3     Soccer pitches of forest lost this hour, most recent data           50,​820    Million metric tons of greenhouse emissions, most recent annual data        Meerut, India Most polluted air today, in sensor range     +0.​97° C   Sep. 2020 increase in global temperature vs. 1900s average       -38.​85%   Today's arctic ice area vs. historic average       {""contentId"":""QF7EIHT0AFB901"",""position"":""greensponsoredby"",""dimensions"":{""small_desktop"":[[190,31]],""large_desktop"":[[190,31]],""tablet"":[[190,31]],""mobile"":[[190,31]]},""positionIncrement"":2,""targeting"":{""position"":""greensponsoredby2"",""positionIncrement"":2,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-17/northvolt-gets-german-loan-guarantee-to-build-battery-cell-plant""},""containerId"":""greensponsoredby-7LY9W9w""}   The guarantee is a stepping stone to the battery cell maker’s plan to operate with Volkswagen AG a “Northvolt Two” plant in Salzgitter, Germany, from 2024, the country’s Economy and Energy Ministry said in an email Monday.

The market for the cells, the basic components of electric vehicle battery packs, may grow to at least 250 billion euros ($296 billion) by 2025, according to European Commission estimates.    Western Europe’s electric vehicle sales pulled ahead of China’s last month, helped by subsidies in Germany and France that have been raised during the coronavirus crisis.
