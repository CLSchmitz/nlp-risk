Tesla plunged as much as 14.7% at its session low. The duo has enjoyed huge rallies after the announcements of their stock splits, which aim to lure more interest from regular investors.Apple, the only U.S. company with a market cap over $2 trillion, soared nearly 40% since the tech giant declared the corporate action on July 30. Meanwhile, the electric-car maker skyrocketed more than 70% following the 5-for-1 stock split announcement on Aug. 11.Their splits took place on Monday, which sparked another knee-jerk pop in both stocks. Tesla jumped more than 12% that day, while Apple gained more than 3%.A stock split theoretically could boost retail share ownership as the cheaper stock price is more accessible for individual investors. However, it doesn’t change a company’s underlying fundamentals or the intrinsic value of its shares.
