The restrictions also have been maintained for citizens from other countries with lower infection rates.Trudeau has dismissed repeated calls from Air Canada to relax air travel restrictions to select countries.The July 27 letter was signed by executives from Air France-KLM and Germany's Lufthansa Group, among others.Trudeau's office and Air France-KLM were not immediately available for comment.""Canada should look to remove the restrictions on travel to European Union and Swiss nationals and allow for a safe, cautious and sensible restoration of travel between two important trading partners,"" the executives said in the letter.
