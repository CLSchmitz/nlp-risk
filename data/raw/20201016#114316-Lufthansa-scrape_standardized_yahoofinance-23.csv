Capacity fell by 95%.Lufthansa’s posted a quarterly operating loss of 1.7 billion euros in the second quarter, worse than last year’s profit of 754 million euros, despite extensive cost reductions. Operating expenses were reduced by 59%, primarily through the introduction of short-time working for large parts of the workforce and the cancellation of non-essential expenditures.At the time of writing, Lufthansa’s shares traded about 2% lower at 8.05 euros, still down over 50% so far this year.Executive comments“We are experiencing a caesura in global air traffic. We do not expect demand to return to pre-crisis levels before 2024. Especially for long-haul routes, there will be no quick recovery. We were able to counteract the effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the first half of the year with strict cost management as well as with the revenues from Lufthansa Technik and Lufthansa Cargo. And we are benefitting from the first signs of recovery on tourist routes, especially with our leisure travel offers of the Eurowings and Edelweiss brands. Nevertheless, we will not be spared a far-reaching restructuring of our business,” Carsten Spohr, Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, said in a press release.Story continues“We are convinced that the entire aviation industry must adapt to a new normal. The pandemic offers our industry a unique opportunity to recalibrate: to question the status quo and, instead of striving for “growth at any price”, to create value in a sustainable and responsible way.”Lufthansa stock forecastMorgan Stanley target price is 5 euros with a high of 14 euros under a bull scenario and zero under the worst-case scenario.

UBS Group set a 5.85 euros price objective and gave the stock a sell rating.We think it is good to sell at the current level and target at least 5 euros in the short-term as 100-day Moving Average and 100-200-day MACD Oscillator signal a strong selling opportunity.The one listed on the U.S. stock exchange is expected to rise to $9.45 in 12 months, two analysts forecast, with a high forecast of $9.45 and a low forecast of $9.45. The average price target represents a -2.48% decrease from the last price of $9.69. Both recommended to ‘Sell’.Analyst comment“While we think Lufthansa has been quick in reducing costs and extending payment terms with suppliers, we think the loss generated by the Covid-19 pandemic (of c€6bn, on our base case estimates) will be difficult to absorb with free cash flow generation and is not yet fully discounted in the share price,” said Carolina Dores, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.“Lufthansa’s large owned fleet and diversified business mix (maintenance, freight and catering business) could give it better flexibility on balance sheet repair and self-help compared to AF-KLM; however, all businesses would be negatively affected by the pandemic and therefore we think much of its balance sheet repair flexibility has been constrained,” the analyst added.Upside and Downside risksA stronger recovery of demand once travel bans are lifted; Greater cost-cutting than we have anticipated; Faster market consolidation and, therefore, higher unit pricing environment, Morgan Stanley highlighted as upside risks to Lufthansa.Failure to secure the German government’s stabilization loan; Higher cost of ramping up operations Delayed turnaround of Eurowings due to stronger competition in the group’s routes, were the major downside risks.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE: Silver Price Daily Forecast – Silver Rallies Above $28.00  ViacomCBS Posts Better-Than-Expected Q2 Revenue on Robust Streaming Demand; Target Price $35  GBP/USD Edges Up to Fresh Four-Month High Following BoE Decision  EUR/USD Meets 1.19, USD/CAD Breaks 1.33 and GBP/JPY Aims Higher  Lufthansa Don’t Expect Air Travel Demand to Return to Pre-COVID-19 levels Before 2024; Sell With Target Price EUR 5  USD/JPY Price Forecast – US Dollar Quiet Against Yen "
