But we’re set up still pretty well.”Fritz’s comments contrast with those of James Foote, CEO of CSX. Foote told shareholders earlier this week that the present economic backdrop is “one of the most puzzling I have experienced in my career.”Late Tuesday, CSX reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed expectations, sending the stock down more than 10%. Union Pacific also dropped after the CSX report.Union Pacific shares rebounded Thursday, rising 5.89% after the company’s own quarterly report exceeded earnings expectations. Revenues, however, were light.Fritz said it’s “critically important” that the U.S. ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trilateral deal that will replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.Trade deals with China as well as Europe and Japan still need to be worked out, he said. ”[But] presuming we do that, I think the economy looks pretty sound to me.”
