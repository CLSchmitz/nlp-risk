The rise in coronavirus cases across the U.S. adds greater urgency to the question of whether more government bailouts are needed, both for the consumers and small businesses that are so vital to any economic rebound and for the airlines and aerospace manufacturers that appear to be at the back of the line for any kind of material recovery.    {""contentId"":""QCJRKNDWX2PT01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-06-26/covid-further-aviation-bailouts-should-have-climate-conditions""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QCJRKNDWX2PT01""}   {""contentId"":""QCJRKNDWX2PT01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-06-26/covid-further-aviation-bailouts-should-have-climate-conditions""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QCJRKNDWX2PT01""}    More from       You Can’t Blame the EU for Not Trusting Boris Johnson      A Republican Health-Care Plan? Still TBD.      Lockdowns Fueled a Splurge on Rolex Watches and Dior Handbags      Red States Are Less Prepared for a Covid Resurgence    On the latter front, a rebound in travel for the typically busy summer season is showing its limits: For starters, the European Union will likely bar U.S. travelers from entering the bloc when borders reopen on July 1, according to the New York Times. Delta Air Lines Inc. warned this week that summer revenue will be a mere quarter of pre-pandemic levels and  said it would likely stop adding back flights this year after August amid little evidence of a meaningful pickup in business or international trips. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., meanwhile, said Boeing Co. had again asked it to curtail output of the air frame for the 737 Max, even as the plane  makes progress toward an eventual return after a 15-month grounding in the wake of two fatal crashes. Spirit will now produce only 37 more Max fuselages this year and warned it may be at risk of breaching financial covenants later this year.     {""contentId"":""QCJRKNDWX2PT01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-06-26/covid-further-aviation-bailouts-should-have-climate-conditions""},""containerId"":""box-qtZNxJv""}   The debt markets remain open for now for most companies, albeit at some fairly steep terms. American Airlines Group Inc.  sold $2.5 billion of junk bonds this week, but the debt was reportedly marketed with a coupon of 11.75% and a discounted price of 99 cents on the dollar, bringing the overall yield to 12.01%. That kind of yield is  more akin to riskier CCC debt, even though the offering was rated in the top tier of junk by Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.        Grounded   Optimism around a rebound in summer travel dried up as virus cases grew in America and the reality of a prolonged aerospace slump sunk in   Source: Bloomberg  <style> .chart-js { display: none; } </style> <img src=""https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iz2ZOs1lXnyw/v0/-1x-1.png"">   Lawmakers appear to be aware that more assistance may be necessary for the aerospace sector. The Treasury Department has weighed safeguarding a largely untapped $17 billion relief fund meant to backstop companies considered crucial to national security in case the likes of Boeing or General Electric Co. end up needing it, people familiar with the matter  told Bloomberg News last week. But if the government is going to be offering more support, lawmakers should consider following the lead of their European brethren, who made assistance conditional on meeting certain environmental standards.   {""contentId"":""QCJRKNDWX2PT01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-06-26/covid-further-aviation-bailouts-should-have-climate-conditions""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QCJRKNDWX2PT01""}   In France, as a condition of the government’s 7 billion euro ($7.9 billion) bailout of Air France-KLM, the carrier will be required to reduce domestic flights by 40%, with a particular focus on  short-haul routes where train-travel alternatives take less than two-and-a-half hours. The country's overall aerospace-sector aid package of 15 billion euros  includes 1.5 billion euros for investing in research and development for cleaner aircraft with a goal of developing a carbon-neutral plane by 2035. Austria, meanwhile, is  requiring the local arm of Deutsche Lufthansa AG to impose minimum ticket prices and add extra fees on shorter routes to discourage unnecessary flights as part of a 450 million euro support plan. A lack of similar stipulations in the U.S. feels like a missed opportunity to make a difference on climate change and likely save some jobs in the process.   The Trump administration hasn’t exactly carved out a niche for itself on the environment. Just this week, the Labor Department proposed an update requiring those overseeing pension and 401(k) plans to always place economic interests above others,  particularly environmental, social and governance goals. But while bailouts for European airlines may have had ESG strings attached for ideological reasons, there’s a way to put America’s signature capitalist spin on this. The best way to make a fleet of planes more environmentally friendly is to fly them less, which is Europe’s primary approach. The next best option is to replace the planes with the newest models and most fuel-efficient engines. Whom does one buy new planes and engines from? Boeing, GE and hundreds of other suppliers, big and small.   An  early draft of the coronavirus stimulus measures from House Democrats included $1 billion for a sort of glorified “cash for clunkers” — a financial crisis-era program meant to incentivize car owners to trade in their older cars for newer, more fuel efficient ones — but for aircraft instead. There are some pitfalls to that, one being that the retirement of older jets isn’t very helpful to an aerospace supply chain that makes most of its money from maintenance and repairs. But the clunkers are being phased out anyway, without any offsetting greasing of the wheels for eventual new purchases. The earlier draft from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also required airlines to begin reducing their carbon emissions by 2025 and to cut them by 50% by 2050. The provisions were blasted in March by Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana as “unrelated handouts for her radical environmental allies” that “have nothing to do with responding to the Covid-19 crisis and helping the American people.” Since that time, Boeing has said it will cut 16,000 jobs and GE is eliminating  13,000 positions so it’s hard to say the legislation that’s already been passed is doing as much as it could to respond to the Covid-19 crisis and help the American people.  {""contentId"":""QCJRKNDWX2PT01"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/opinion/articles/2020-06-26/covid-further-aviation-bailouts-should-have-climate-conditions""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QCJRKNDWX2PT01""}   On the “America First” front, the inescapable reality is that Boeing will emerge from this crisis with an uncomfortable amount of debt, whereas Airbus and its supplier counterparts will have a 1.5 billion euro pile of money from which to draw to further advance their technological lead. It’s something to think about at least.  Elsewhere in aviation, and in a surprising move, American on Friday said it would start selling flights to capacity as of July 1, abandoning efforts to keep seats empty when possible to help ensure social distancing. The logic and timing of this move escapes me, coming as it does just one day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded its guidance on those at risk of serious illness from the virus. It’s the direct opposite of a call earlier this week from the carrier's Allied Pilots Association for the government to actually pay to keep seats empty on flights, the idea being that this would make more passengers comfortable to fly and allow the airlines to add back more capacity overall. That actually sounds like a pretty good idea to me, but it may be hard to sell that kind of plan to a federal government that seems allergic to much simpler fixes such as mandating face masks.   PUTTING NUMBERS AROUND FACTORY ‘RESHORING’ The upheaval wrought by the pandemic on globalized supply chains has  sparked a conversation about whether one of the lasting effects for manufacturers may be a return of work to North America. The extent to which this  “reshoring"" phenomenon is a meaningful trend or applies to only a select few companies remains a matter of debate. But factory automation-equipment makers Rockwell Automation Inc. and Emerson Electric Co. both say they’re already talking to customers about this, with some ready to make a transition within the next few quarters, Barclays Plc analyst Julian Mitchell said by phone this week. He sizes the reshoring of manufacturing activity as a potential $70 billion market opportunity over five years, with about 15% of this directly linked to automation equipment. This is a clear benefit for Rockwell, which alone might see as much as a $2.5 billion opportunity, Mitchell estimated in a report last month. Because Rockwell has an above-average market share in the U.S. and higher margins domestically, it's poised to benefit even if the world's spending on factory-floor investment merely gets reallocated to different geographies instead of growing as a whole. The emphasis on  reshoring via robots is unlikely to translate into much in the way of factory-based jobs in the U.S. over the long-term. But Mitchell points out that if 15% of the spending is for automation equipment, that still leaves a big piece of the $70 billion pie for makers of traditional manufacturing equipment, construction workers and other jobs vital to overall plant infrastructure.   DEALS, ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE General Electric announced this week that it’s dropping KPMG as its auditor after 111 years. Deloitte will now get the unhappy task of sifting through the still sprawling and tangled web of GE’s financials — or perhaps that’s a happy task based on the size of the fees GE has historically paid its auditors. Either way, this has been a  long time coming, and GE’s decision to finally pull off the Band-Aid is  an important step in CEO Larry Culp’s journey to restore the company’s credibility. It’s still not entirely clear to me why it took so long to both come to the conclusion that a new auditor was needed and to actually announce a replacement. “Have you guys started maybe evaluating other auditors given what’s happened here?” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Steve Tusa asked then-CEO John Flannery in January of 2018 after the company announced a  mammoth $15 billion reserve shortfall for an insurance business that was allegedly reviewed each year by KPMG. “If these guys reviewed this stuff every year for the last several years and this is kind of the result of that, doesn’t that kind of raise questions?” Yeah, it kind of does. Later that year, about a third of participating GE shareholders voted against retaining KPMG as the company’s auditor. Culp announced shortly after his hiring in late 2018 that the company would explore a change and entertain bids from other auditors. A reminder that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the  Department of Justice continue to  investigate the insurance shortfall and accounting involving long-term service agreements, as well as a $22 billion goodwill  writedown in GE’s power unit.   Waste Management Inc. adjusted the terms of its takeover of Advanced Disposal Services Inc. to reflect the fallout from the coronavirus on the garbage-hauling business and antitrust regulators’ demands for higher-than-expected divestitures. Waste Management will now pay $30.30 a share in cash, or $4.6 billion including debt. That’s down 9% from its initial offer of $33.15. Waste Management and Advanced Disposal simultaneously announced an agreement to sell assets representing $345 million in revenue to rival trash hauler GFL Environmental Inc. for $835 million in a bid to win regulatory approval. The GFL deal should address “substantially all” of the divestitures expected to be required by the Department of Justice, the companies said in a statement. Waste Management now expects the deal to close in the third quarter and it’s on the hook to pay a $250 million termination fee to Advanced Disposal if the tie-up fails to pass regulatory muster under certain circumstances. That extended timeline is a problem for Waste Management bondholders, who had pushed up the price of debt issued to fund the transaction on the assumption it would close as expected in the second quarter. They may now be looking at a loss based on redemption provisions for the notes. Those bondholders are now exploring their options, Bloomberg News’s Molly Smith reports.   Schneider Electric SE and Emerson Electric Co. are among the manufacturing companies exploring a takeover of industrial-software maker OSIsoft LLC, Bloomberg News  reported this week, citing people familiar with the matter. A sale could reportedly fetch $4 billion. SoftBank Group Corp. is a minority shareholder through its Vision Fund and had been looking to divest the holding as part of an effort to raise cash following several high-profile blowups including WeWork. The potential stake sale ended up attracting offers for the entire company, the people said. Both Emerson and Schneider have experience acquiring industrial-software firms and have carved out this field as a priority for future investment. OSIsoft, formerly known as Oil Systems Inc., sells software that generates predictive insights based on data streams and counts the oil and gas industry, utilities and manufacturers as customers.   W.W. Grainger Inc. agreed to sell its industrial-distribution business in China to the local management team and venture-capital firm Sinovation Ventures. Terms weren’t disclosed, and Grainger will retain its global sourcing operations in China. This is just the latest step in Grainger’s efforts to unwind international ventures that haven’t panned out as well as hoped. The company earlier this month agreed to sell its under-performing Fabory European operations to private equity firm Torqx Capital Partners. A streamlined focus on North America could lead Grainger to evaluate an acquisition of HD Supply Holdings Inc.’s  high-margin facilities maintenance division, says RBC analyst Deane Dray. HD Supply’s spinoff of its construction and industrial business has been temporarily postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
