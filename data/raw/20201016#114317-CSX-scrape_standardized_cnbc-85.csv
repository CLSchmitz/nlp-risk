A strong and growing position in the cloud  market is among the factors cited.  American Express  — Goldman Sachs downgraded Amex shares to “neutral” from  “buy,” saying the financial giant’s results would remain volatile  and that management appears unwilling to take strategic actions  that would unlock more value.  CSX — The  railroad company reported fourth quarter profit of 48 cents per  share, two cents above estimates. However, revenue fell  below forecasts on lower shipment volumes, and CSX said a weak  global economy and other factors would hurt its 2016 results.  Salesforce.com  — Brean Capital initiated coverage on the business software  maker with a “buy” rating, noting that its offerings are rapidly  replacing companies like SAP and Oracle as de facto  industry standards.  Ally  Financial — Ally may be willing to sell all or  part of itself, according to The New York Times.  Apple — Apple would be interested in any  potential Time Warner spinoff, according to the New York  Post. The paper said Apple’s interest stems from the  possibility of the company launching a stand-alone streaming TV  service.  Progress  Software — Progress earned an adjusted 53  cents per share for its latest quarter, 4 cents above  estimates, but its revenue fell short of forecasts. The  maker of business applications software gave some mixed guidance,  projecting lower-than-expected current quarter profit, but overall  2016 earnings above estimates.    Tractor  Supply — The retailer cut its full-year  forecast because of unusually warm weather impacting the sale of  cold weather goods. Heating equipment, snow blowers, and  generators are among the wide variety of products sold by Tractor  Supply.  PayPal  Holdings — Mizuho began coverage of PayPal  with a “buy” rating, saying the payment service is a dominant  online payment platform in a unique position to gain even more  share.  TiVo — The maker of digital video  recorders named Chief Financial Officer Naveen Chopra as its  interim chief executive officer, effective January 30. He  replaces Tom Rogers, who moves to the role of non-executive  chairman. Rogers had previously announced his intention to  step down from the CEO post.  Ford  Motor — The automaker declared a $1 billion  supplemental cash dividend, amounting to 25 cents per share, and  also said it expected to report a record 2015 pre-tax profit.  MetLife — MetLife is planning to  split off its U.S. retail insurance business from the rest of the  company, prompted by the current regulatory environment. The company is considering a variety of approaches,  including an initial public offering, a spinoff, or a sale.  Walt  Disney — Disney announced it would open its  new Shanghai theme park on June 16, following five years of  construction. Disney originally had planned to open the new  park during 2015.  Yum  Brands — The restaurant operator reported that  December same-store sales in China rose by 1 percent, driven by  a 5 percent gain at its KFC unit. That helped offset an  11 percent same-store sales drop at Pizza Hut. Yum is in  the process of spinning off its China business.  Stryker — Stryker raised its  full-year 2015 guidance, with the medical device maker saying  sales came in at the upper end of its prior forecast. The  company was also helped by the suspension of an excise tax on  medical devices. Stryker will release its fourth-quarter  results for 2015 on January 26.  Qualcomm — The chipmaker formed a $3  billion joint venture with Japan’s TDK to make components used in  a wide variety of wireless devices.

Anthem — The health insurer said it  could save as much as $3 billion per year in drug costs, thanks  to a re-pricing provision in its current contract with pharmacy  benefits manager Express Scripts.  Aetna — CEO Mark Bertolini said the  insurer will not give up on the public health exchange market, despite losing money this past year. Competitor  UnitedHealth Group recently said it was considering getting  out of that business due to high costs and lower-than-expected  enrollment.  Aeropostale — Aeropostale is weighing  a reverse stock split, in order to regain compliance with New  York Stock Exchange listing rule.
