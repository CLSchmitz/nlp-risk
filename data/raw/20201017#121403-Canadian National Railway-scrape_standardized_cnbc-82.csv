And while it  could be an incredible product, these days it seems more like  Avon—which has been crushed for years because of awful  management.  Cramer thinks the product is fantastic, because he sees so many  people in media that are literally begging users to follow them  by featuring his handle and asking people to participate in  quizzes and polls. It’s free promotion that most companies would  kill to have.  “I think Twitter might kill the golden goose itself, purely out  of arrogance, mismanagement, and a mistaken belief that they are  always going to be the only game in town,” the “Mad Money” host  said. (Tweet This)  That is precisely why Cramer was so happy with the announcement  that Dick  Costolo is stepping down, because he has never heard  more complaints about a CEO in business than he has about him.  However, Cramer was also severely disappointed with Twitter’s  reaction to Costolo. He would have expected the company to kick  out Costolo, and then bring in a CEO with a plan to restore user  and ad growth. Did that happen? Nope!   Investors saw the same ridiculous action when Andrea Jung stepped  down as CEO of Avon and then stayed on as an executive chairwoman,  which defeated any actions taken by the new CEO Sheri McCoy.  There are some investors who have great ideas about saving  Twitter, Cramer said, such as the major shareholder Chris Sacca.  However, it appears that Twitter is just too arrogant to accept  any constructive criticism, even from a large stakeholder like  Sacca.  “Mark my words, if Twitter doesn’t get its act together, it will  be the first big fizzle of the second Internet revolution,”  Cramer said.
