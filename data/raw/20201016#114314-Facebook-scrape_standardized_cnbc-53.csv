It’s a successor to last year’s Quest and, like that version, doesn’t require a computer to run. Everything you need to use VR is bundled inside.This is the strategy Facebook is taking moving forward. It’s ditching the Oculus Rift headset, which required a PC to operate.You can still run advanced PC virtual reality games designed for the Rift on the Quest 2 using an Oculus Link USB-C cable. Oculus Link was in beta on the original Oculus Quest, but now it’s an official feature. This is Facebook’s long-term vision: a headset you can use anywhere you want, but that you can still link to a PC to render games that require more powerful hardware.
