Deutsche Lufthansa AG would like more regulatory consistency and predictability, spokesman Helmut Tolksdorf said on Friday.  The initiative by the commission, the EU’s executive arm, needs the approval of member-country governments. It would amount to a non-binding recommendation covering their actions in the field of health and travel.  The commission said it hoped for approval by EU governments “in the coming weeks.” Health Minister Jens Spahn of Germany, which as holder of the bloc’s rotating presidency will be in charge of brokering a deal, gave no timeline, but said it was important that there was general consensus in the group.  {""contentId"":""QG4N10T1UM1301"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-04/eu-moves-to-limit-threat-of-new-internal-travel-disruptions""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QG4N10T1UM1301""}   “The virus knows no border and therefore, in combating it, we should have no borders either,” Spahn said in a news conference.  Specifically, the commission recommended: common criteria and thresholds for member countries when deciding whether to impose travel restrictions a map of common criteria using an agreed color code a joint framework for measures applied to travelers from high-risk areas “clear and timely” information to the public about any restrictions   The commission proposed that each EU government weighing restrictions take into account the total number of newly notified Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in a given area over a 14-day period; the percentage of positive results from all Covid-19 tests carried out in a given area during a seven-day period; and the number of tests carried out per 100,000 people in a given area during a seven-day period.  On the color code, the commission recommended four categories: green, orange, red and gray.  The commission said that people traveling from an area classified as “red” or “gray” should either face a quarantine period or take a Covid-19 test after arrival, with testing being the preferred option.  {""contentId"":""QG4N10T1UM1301"",""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-04/eu-moves-to-limit-threat-of-new-internal-travel-disruptions""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-2-QG4N10T1UM1301""}   — With assistance by Richard Weiss, and Iain Rogers  (Updates with Lufthansa in fifth paragraph, German health minister from eighth paragraph)   Published on ‎4‎ ‎September‎, ‎2020‎ ‎14‎:‎09  Updated on  ‎4‎ ‎September‎, ‎2020‎ ‎15‎:‎55        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
