The shakeup of banking systems around the world raises the question: “Which banks are the safest?” For the past 21 years, Global Finance has compiled a list of the world’s 50 safest banks, and with the European debt crisis ongoing, and slowing growth having an impact on bank credit ratings, long-term safety of banks is of key interest. According to Global Finance, credit ratings and rankings of most European banks have suffered except for those at the very top of the list – those that have explicit banking from triple-A rated governments. This ranking of safe banks was created through the comparison of long-term credit ratings (from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch) and analyses of total assets owned by the 500 largest banks in the world. For ease of comparison, we’ve listed the highest-ranking bank in each country, since many of the highly ranked banks are headquartered in the same country. It may be a surprise where you’ll find the safest banks in the world. Click ahead to for the list! By Justin Menzan & Paul ToscanoPosted 16 Aug 2012
