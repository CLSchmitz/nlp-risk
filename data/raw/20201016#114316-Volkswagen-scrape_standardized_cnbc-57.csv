It plans to invest 6 billion euros ($7 billion) in e-car production, of which 1.3 billion will be invested in its German plants at Braunschweig, Salzgitter and Kassel.“In the first wave alone, around 10 million VW group cars will be based on this platform,” the company’s head of electric mobility, Thomas Ulbrich, said in a presentation in Dresden.The company did not give a timeline for the forecast, but stood by its existing target of selling 3 million units per year by 2025 of the 50 battery-powered group models it plans.Volkswagen, like other German auto makers, is pushing into volume production of electric cars as U.S. rival Tesla struggles to scale up manufacturing of its Model 3, its first car to target the mass market.BMW and Daimler also plan to ramp up e-car output in the coming years.
