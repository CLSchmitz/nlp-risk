On Oct. 9, a journalist at the state-backed tabloid the Global Times tweeted about its launch.China’s so-called Great Firewall blocks websites such as Facebook and its services like Instagram as well as Google and Twitter. Content on Chinese websites is also heavily censored, particularly if it is deemed politically sensitive by Beijing.A virtual private network or VPN is required to access any blocked sites in China. But the Tuber app allowed users to access these services without a VPN.There were some caveats to the Tuber app however. Users had to register with their identity card information and phone number, according to Reuters and TechCrunch, which both tested the app.
