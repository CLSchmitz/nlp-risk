A  30-lesson package costs 690 euros (about $925) and can be taken  two, four or five times a week.“I had the idea that perhaps teaching English on trains was in  fact a way of using time more efficiently,” MacDougall told CNBC  in a phone interview. “I took the idea to SNCF, who were very keen  and very eager to put a service in place, and they have given us  extremely good support all the way through it.”(Read more: Millennial train hopes  to inspire a ‘nation of tinkerers’)The service is not just a way of making commutes use their  journeys more effectively. It’s also a way of improving the  language skills of the French at a time when some reports  argue that English proficiency is declining.According the English Proficiency Index (EPI) compiled annually by  English First, France is ranked at 35 out of 60 nations where  English is not the first language. It was listed under the “low  proficiency” category, one above the United Arab Emirates but one  below China. It was the lowest placed European country that  English First analyzed, and it was one of two European  countries where proficiency decreased in the last six years.However, MacDougall argued that the findings such as those  of the EPI were not necessarily accurate.“I’m not sure I agree thatthe English proficiency has gone down  in France,” he said. “There are a lot of students taking advantage  of Erasmus years or doing part or all of their studies  internationally, so the level of English is in  fact increasing.” He added, “But not, I would say,  across the board. It’s more for people doing further education.”(Read more: France:Anti-business  image is ‘Anglo-Saxon caricature’)MacDougall said that he aims to keep lessons at a maximum of six  people as it was compatible with the type of teaching that his  organization provides, but he said that if they had sufficient  demand they would possibly increase the number of lessons taking  part each train. At the moment there is just one lesson per train.French trains work well for the course given the noise levels and  the way the carriage is laid out, MacDougall explained. “There is  a specific part of the carriage which we’re assigned which is in  fact quite convenient for the purpose of giving an  English lesson,” he said. “It’s not separated from the rest of the  carriage but it’s quite quiet and allows us the intimacy that we  need for an English lesson.”Many of the French commuters participating in “English on track”  have most if not all of their tuition fees paid for by their  employers, MacDougall explained, as it offered valuable training  whilst also not eating into the work day.Talking to the AFP, David Potier, SNCF sales director for the  Champagne-Ardenne region said, “We have limited places but if  there is strong demand, we will look at adding lessons to the  return trains in the evening.”And what of such a scheme being introduced in other countries, or,  for example, on the Eurostar, which connects France and the U.K?A Eurostar spokesperson told CNBC via email: “The ‘English on  track’ scheme being run by SNCF is such a lovely  initiative. Language skills are invaluable in the business  environment and the idea of giving commuters the chance to enhance  their learning whilst travelling to and from work is a very  interesting one.“We will follow this pilot with interest, and would be very keen  to hear more on the results.”"
