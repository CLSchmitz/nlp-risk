That brings the total number of canceled Max orders, including those where buyers converted one type of jet to a different model, to 436 jets, Boeing said.Cancellations of all jet models stood at 448 for the year.On the delivery side, Boeing handed to airline customers 10 twin-aisle jets in September, down from 25 a year earlier and 12 in August.That brings total deliveries to 98 for the first nine months of 2020, down from 301 aircraft for the same period a year ago.Deliveries are a closely watched metric for investors since airlines hand over the bulk of the money for an order when they pick up their planes at Boeing.The September delivery tally included one P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, and three freighters: one 747 to United Parcel Service, one 767 to FedEx Corp and one 777 to Lufthansa Cargo, Boeing said.It also included seven 787 Dreamliner jets: one for leasing company AerCap Holdings, three for United Airlines , two for Turkish Airlines and one 787-10 to Taiwan’s EVA Air, the planemaker said.
