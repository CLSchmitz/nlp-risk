Schatz says the uproar is not something he would base his investment thesis on.The selloff came as Trump called for a boycott of Goodyear following the release of an internal company note telling employees they cannot wear MAGA garb. “Don’t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!),” Trump tweeted to his 85.4 million followers.Goodyear later clarified its position, saying it applies to all political themed attire. Trump at an afternoon presser reportedly said he was open to changing the tires on the presidential limo from Goodyear.Shares of Goodyear fell slightly in Thursday’s trading session.<img alt=""In this Nov. 30, 2017 photo the Goodyear brand name is molded into the sidewall of a tire at a Goodyear Auto Service Center, in Stoneham, Mass.

If it’s an American company, we should do our best to support American companies. With that, I think Goodyear falls in the industrial category. If there’s going to be another leg higher in the bull market, I think we are going to see the industrial sector complex take more of a leadership role. I’m not running to buy GM or Ford, but something like Goodyear would be one I look at along with the broad complex,” Schatz said.However, Goodyear has done its part to convince investors now isn’t the right time to pull the trigger on its stock — irrespective of Trump’s hot air.Goodyear’s second quarter sales plunged 41% to $2.1 billion as auto manufacturers shut plants down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tire unit volumes crashed 45% from the prior year. The company has lost $1.3 billion through the first six months of the year.Story continuesThe stock is down 68% over the past five years, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
