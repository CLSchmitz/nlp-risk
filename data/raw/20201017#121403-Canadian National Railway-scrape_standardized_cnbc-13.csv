Since January the S&P/TSX Composite Index has climbed 14 percent, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, more than double the S&P 500′s 6 percent year-to-date gain. That’s made the country a  favorite destination for investors. With near-$1 billion in net  inflows, the iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC) has received the most new money of any non-U.S. country fund so far this year. Some might hope these gains are thanks to Justin Trudeau, Canada’s recently installed easy-on-the-eyes prime minister, but  domestic issues don’t tend to drive the Canadian market. Those caught up in the U.S. presidential election may wonder if it’s a “what if Trump wins” preemptive move. But there’s a more obvious, nonpolitical explanation."
