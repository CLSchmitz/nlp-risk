Their goal: to divide the American populace and help elect Donald Trump president. Right after the 2016 election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed as “crazy” the idea that fake news on Facebook could have influenced the election. A year later, Zuckerberg said he regretted saying that.Since then, the company has insisted that it had learned from its mistakes.But over the past 12 months, Facebook has frustrated some users and employees with its policy decisions around speech on its platform, and its haphazard enforcement of those policies.These decisions loom large considering that Facebook has 198 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada. Adding to the concern is the limited oversight over Zuckerberg’s handling of the company. Zuckerberg holds more than 51% of voting shares, and in 2019, he pushed out several directors who questioned his authority, according to The Wall Street Journal.“Elections are different now and so are we. We’ve created new products, partnerships, and policies to make sure this election is secure,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. “We’ve faced criticism from Republicans for being biased against conservatives and Democrats for not taking more steps to restrict the exact same content. Our job is to create one consistent set of rules that applies equally to everyone.”
