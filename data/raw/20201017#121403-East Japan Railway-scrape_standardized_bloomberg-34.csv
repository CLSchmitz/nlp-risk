Why share a run with a bunch of strangers—who may or may not be taking proper Covid-19 precautions—when you can ski the best powder of your life among a tight circle of friends or family? As long as you can confidently tackle blues, consider yourself ready for the ultimate in private downhill thrill-seeking. Whether you’re looking for extreme steeps or mellow cruisers, here’s where to take flight around the world.      Chugach Mountains, Alaska    #lazy-img-365150844:before{padding-top:66.68181818181817%;} Photographer: Jed Workman  When: A short season limits you to freezing-but-snowy March or sunnier April.    Why: The sparkling Mount Diamond, 150 miles east of Anchorage, serves up 6,200 feet in a single drop, and it’s not even the tallest among this range. Runs average 3,500 vertical feet with 40F temps in a coastal location; moist snow means more stability underfoot.    {""contentId"":""QHVMMDT0G1NQ01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-08/8-top-destinations-worth-taking-the-heli-skiing-plunge""},""containerId"":""box-YgF6nnC""}   Who: Originally founded by extreme-skiing legend Doug Coombs in 1993, Valdez Heli-Ski Guides counts some of the most experienced instructors in the business.  Seven-day packages from $5,900 per person      Coast Range, British Columbia    #lazy-img-365150747:before{padding-top:66.6988416988417%;} Source: Bella Coola Heli Sports  When: Late March and early April offer long and frequent bluebird days.  Why: This region is known for quad-burning runs stretching as long as 6,000 vertical feet through old-growth forests, all on fluffy Pacific powder.  Who: With exclusive access to 3.25 million acres of terrain, Bella Coola Heli Sports’ permit area is as vast as the entire Swiss Alps. This year, it also offers yacht-based heli trips that blend fjord cruising with kayaking and fresh tracks. Eight-day packages from $239,875 for as many as eight people    La Parva, Chile    #lazy-img-365151372:before{padding-top:66.95454545454545%;} Photographer: Paulo Brandt/500px Plus  When: August, when cold smoke powder—a light and dry snow—is prevalent.  Why: Bowls filled with stomach-dropping cornices and seemingly endless gullies have made this small but mighty resort a regular stop on the Freeskiing World Tour. Strong intermediates can test their mettle on demanding runs averaging 4,300 feet down.  Who: Veteran guide Greg Harms, owner of Third Edge Heli, skied the world before dubbing La Parva his Shangri-La. His trips include lodging at Casa Farellones, an intimate hideaway with panoramic mountain views.  Seven days from $29,000 per person    San Juan Mountains, Colorado    #lazy-img-365151375:before{padding-top:60.72727272727273%;} Photographer: zachdischner/RooM RF   More from       Mary Berry’s Simple Recipe for Double-Baked Mushroom Souffles      Covid Surge Puts Europe’s Restaurant Revival in Peril      Trump Painting May Fetch $750,000 at Auction Before Election      Brooklyn Museum Waives Tradition to Auction Its Treasures    When: The snowpack is most reliable in March and April.  Why: The contiguous U.S. has few options for heli-skiing. Not only does this exception claim some of the highest and steepest skiable elevations in North America, but it’s also great for snowcat skiing, which is more accessible and less dependent on pristine weather. The San Juan’s varied runs sit largely above the tree line and average 1,000 to 3,000 vertical feet.  Who: Silverton Powdercats can access 6,000-plus acres of terrain. For experts, Silverton Mountain resort has a wide range of single or multiday options.  Single heli drops from $179    Hokkaido, Japan    #lazy-img-365150990:before{padding-top:71.4090909090909%;} Photographer: Sam Roche  When: January—or “Japanuary” as powder hounds say—is usually the snowiest month of the year.  Why: Unfathomably deep, superlight fluff tops slopes that are often less steep than your typical resort black. The thrills are visual, with birch forests offsetting open glades.  Who: Hokkaido Backcountry Club offers six top-to-bottom runs of the dormant Shiribetsu-Dake volcano, totaling 21,786 vertical feet.  Single days from $1,530 per person    Southern Alps, New Zealand    #lazy-img-365150801:before{padding-top:66.63636363636364%;} Source: Southern Lakes Heliski  When: Prime conditions are in August.  Why: This area’s treeless terrain also stands out for its coveted spring corn—soft, forgiving snow that’s not too wet or slushy.  Who: Harris Mountains Heli-Ski is the largest operator in Queenstown, which improves the likelihood of being grouped with skiers and snowboarders of the same ability.  Single days from $800 per person    European Alps    #lazy-img-365151051:before{padding-top:66.72727272727273%;} Photographer: David Carlier  When: February and March provide better snow depth on the glaciers.  Why: A single, intermediate-friendly glacier run can last the whole day—a rare treat in the skiing world. Use it as an excuse to link from valley to valley, stopping midway for a leisurely outdoor lunch in true European style. You can find yourself under the Matterhorn in Switzerland on one day and below Mont Blanc in France the next.  Who: SwisSkiSafari owner Danielle Stynes skis and snowboards every line to uncover the best hotels and restaurants across a region that spans Italy, France, and Switzerland. From $1,500 per person per day   Greenland    #lazy-img-365151443:before{padding-top:66.73387096774194%;} Source: Arctic Heli Skiing  When: May brings the possibility of skiing under the midnight sun.  Why: Summit-to-sea runs span 4,000 vertical feet or more, plus the chance of a polar bear sighting. The variety of wide-open, low-angled glacier runs makes it accessible (and less intimidating) for first-time heli-skiers as well.  Who: Hearty meals and a taste of local culture at Hotel Kulusuk on the eastern side of Greenland round out trips from the local trailblazer, Arctic Heli Skiing.
