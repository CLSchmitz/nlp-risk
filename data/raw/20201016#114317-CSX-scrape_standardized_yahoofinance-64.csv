With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine CSX’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for CSX What's the opportunity in CSX?CSX appears to be overvalued by 20% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$77.87 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $64.87. This means that the opportunity to buy CSX at a good price has disappeared! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since CSX’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will CSX generate?<img alt=""NasdaqGS:CSX Past and Future Earnings, February 10th 2020"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XHrbAufPXsOeftlNXuG3Rw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/f889206caa779b388ad81b313b1b7e95"" class=""caas-img"">NasdaqGS:CSX Past and Future Earnings, February 10th 2020Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of CSX, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 5.2%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in CSX’s future outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe CSX should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CSX for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
