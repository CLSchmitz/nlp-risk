Photographer: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg    Photographer: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg   Germany’s main aviation industry group has proposed the creation of limited air-travel corridors between major U.S. and European hubs, a bid to crack open the nearly dormant market for trans-Atlantic flight.    The pilot projects would link U.S. airports in Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles and New York City-adjacent Newark, N.J., with Frankfurt and Munich in Germany, along with other major European intercontinental hubs, executives at BDL, which represents Germany’s airports and airlines, said in an online press event Wednesday.     The proposal, which would require passengers to produce a negative test for Covid-19 before flying, is an effort to revive a market that’s the industry’s biggest profit producer and help major European airline groups such as Deutsche Lufthansa AG and IAG SA recover from the pandemic. London-New York was the world’s top revenue-generating route with more than $1 billion in annual sales before governments imposed lengthy travel bans to contain the coronavirus earlier this year.    {""contentId"":""QFB0W6T0AFB501"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-19/german-airlines-pitch-plan-to-nudge-open-trans-atlantic-flights""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QFB0W6T0AFB501""}   {""contentId"":""QFB0W6T0AFB501"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-19/german-airlines-pitch-plan-to-nudge-open-trans-atlantic-flights""},""containerId"":""box-DKeKSHW""}   Covid-19 testing exists at the German airports and could quickly be installed elsewhere, according to the BDL executives, Matthias von Randow and Peter Gerber.            Atlantic Exposure  British Airways owner IAG is most exposed on U.S. to Europe flights   Source: OAG  NOTE: IAG and American operate a revenue-sharing partnership, as do Delta, Air France-KLM and Virgin, and United and Lufthansa <style> .chart-js { display: none; } </style> <img src=""https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ivFlFlCnToqs/v0/-1x-1.png"">   Lufthansa, IAG and Air France-KLM all have commercial partnerships with one of the large U.S. network airlines. However, the plan will need to involve the foreign, transport and health ministries in Germany alone, while a multitude of international authorities have to agree on which kind of test would be accepted, BDL said.  {""contentId"":""QFB0W6T0AFB501"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-19/german-airlines-pitch-plan-to-nudge-open-trans-atlantic-flights""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QFB0W6T0AFB501""}   Four major airlines in the U.S. and Europe last month called on U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Ylva Johansson, the European commissioner for home affairs, to reach an international agreement on testing to allow broad trans-Atlantic travel.  {""contentId"":""QFB0W6T0AFB501"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-19/german-airlines-pitch-plan-to-nudge-open-trans-atlantic-flights""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QFB0W6T0AFB501""}   A reopening of trans-Atlantic flight would give a huge boost to major network carriers, which on the U.S. side include Delta Air Lines Inc., American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. The International Air Transport Association has warned that long-distance flying will take years to return to 2019 levels and has urged countries to unify travel rules to speed the comeback.  United, Delta  Constantly changing restrictions have held back the aviation recovery in Europe, while state-by-state outbreaks have limited U.S. domestic travel. The U.S. government has so far been unwilling to impose any restrictions on airline passengers, such as requiring face coverings or temperature checks. All such measures have been imposed by carriers themselves or local agencies and airports.  {""contentId"":""QFB0W6T0AFB501"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-19/german-airlines-pitch-plan-to-nudge-open-trans-atlantic-flights""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QFB0W6T0AFB501""}   United is in close touch with its partner Lufthansa on the German proposal, spokeswoman Leslie Scott said in an email. “As we indicated in the letter to U.S. and European authorities, we support passenger testing as a means of safely re-opening international markets,” she said.  Delta said it would be “premature” to comment on the report. “We are still working on what our position should be as it relates to testing and international travel,” a spokeswoman said by email.

A spokeswoman for Boston Logan International, Jennifer Mehigan, said the airport isn’t aware of the German effort. It doesn’t have any coronavirus testing measures, though some airlines do their own testing for international flight crews.  Europe’s busiest airport hub, London Heathrow, is working on a testing mechanism and industry executives are lobbying the British government to replace quarantines with virus tests as a means of screening travelers from high-risk countries. A spokeswoman for Heathrow said it wasn’t involved in the German proposal.  {""contentId"":""QFB0W6T0AFB501"",""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-19/german-airlines-pitch-plan-to-nudge-open-trans-atlantic-flights""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-2-QFB0W6T0AFB501""}   Aeroports de Paris said it isn’t aware of the German plan either, though has already started testing at its hubs. A negative test is required to enter the country from some nations.  Traffic between Paris airports and North America was down 94% in July, according to hub-operator ADP’s monthly report.  {""contentId"":""QFB0W6T0AFB501"",""position"":""in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article2"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-08-19/german-airlines-pitch-plan-to-nudge-open-trans-atlantic-flights""},""containerId"":""in-article-2-QFB0W6T0AFB501""}   — With assistance by Siddharth Vikram Philip, Tara Patel, Mary Schlangenstein, Alan Levin, and Justin Bachman  (Updates with ADP comment in penultimate paragraph)    Published on ‎19‎ ‎August‎, ‎2020‎ ‎13‎:‎16  Updated on  ‎19‎ ‎August‎, ‎2020‎ ‎19‎:‎06        Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
