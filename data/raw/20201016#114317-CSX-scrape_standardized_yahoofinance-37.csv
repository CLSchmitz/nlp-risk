Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for CSX:0.13 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$39b - US$2.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2020.)So, CSX has an ROCE of 13%.  See our latest analysis for CSX Is CSX's ROCE Good?One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies. CSX's ROCE appears to be substantially greater than the 11% average in the Transportation industry. We would consider this a positive, as it suggests it is using capital more effectively than other similar companies. Separate from CSX's performance relative to its industry, its ROCE in absolute terms looks satisfactory, and it may be worth researching in more depth.Our data shows that CSX currently has an ROCE of 13%, compared to its ROCE of 10% 3 years ago. This makes us wonder if the company is improving.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for CSX.Do CSX's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Current liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.CSX has current liabilities of US$2.2b and total assets of US$39b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 5.7% of its total assets. In addition to low current liabilities (making a negligible impact on ROCE), CSX earns a sound return on capital employed.The Bottom Line On CSX's ROCEIf CSX can continue reinvesting in its business, it could be an attractive prospect.
