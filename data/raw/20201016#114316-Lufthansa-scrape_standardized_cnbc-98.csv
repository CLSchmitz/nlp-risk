French officials said a black box recovered from the ill-fated  plane — Flight 4U9525′s cockpit voice recorder — was  damaged but could still shed light on what prompted the Airbus  A320 to descend rapidly and crashing into the Alps, killing all  150 people aboard. Some Germanwings crew members have refused to  fly following the unexplained accident.  French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve acknowledged that all  possible explanations for the crash are being considered, but  told RTL radio that terrorist action is not the most likely  theory.
