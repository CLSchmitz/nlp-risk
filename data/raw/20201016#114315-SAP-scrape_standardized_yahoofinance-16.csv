As always, Shots are short-form Equity episodes that focus on a single, news topic.Why is SAP spinning Qualtrics out via an IPO?Building off of Danny's SAP knowledge, Natasha's curiosity about the future Qualtrics  S-1, and my own recent dive into the SAP and Qualtrics numbers, we managed to cover quite a lot of ground. So, if you wanted to know:Why did SAP have to pay so much for Qualtrics back in the day?Why is SAP willing to part with Qualtrics so soon after buying it?How much might Qualtrics be worth?And, of course, did the Equity team expect to see this news in 2020?Then you are probably going to like what we have in store for you.Spoiler on that last as the answer is a firm no, but, all the same, what fun. That's about it for this Equity Shot, hit play, have fun, and we are back Friday morning unless something else happens, like a Palantir S-1.Equity drops every Monday at 7:00 a.m. PDT and Friday at 6:00 a.m. PDT, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.
