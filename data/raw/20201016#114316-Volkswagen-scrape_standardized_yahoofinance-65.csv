VW in March rejected the criticism but admitted that the cars needed last minute improvements.Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess last week drove the Tesla Model Y and praised the vehicle.""This car is for us in many aspects (not in all!) a reference: user experience, updatability, driving features, performance of the top of the range models, charging network, range,"" Diess said.The VW brand plans to build 1.5 million electric cars by 2025. Volkswagen Group, whose brands also include Porsche, Audi, Skoda, Bentley and Bugatti, will launch 75 electric cars by 2029 and be capable of building 26 million vehicles.(Reporting by Edward Taylor, editing by Thomas Escritt)"
