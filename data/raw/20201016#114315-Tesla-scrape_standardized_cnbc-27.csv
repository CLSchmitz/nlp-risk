Musk is notorious, however, for being overly optimistic with his predictions.In response to one shareholder’s follow-up question about lowering pricing, Musk acknowledged, “It’s not like Tesla’s profitability is crazy high. Our average profitability for the last four quarters was maybe 1%. It’s not like we’re minting money. Our valuation makes it seem like we are, but we’re not.”
