The European Central Bank is running down its stock of so-called commercial paper -- short-term debt instruments issued by companies to meet immediate funding needs -- while the Bank of England announced plans to discontinue purchases.    {""contentId"":""QHS0ZFDWX2PS01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-07/europe-s-bond-binge-quells-demand-for-once-pivotal-stimulus""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QHS0ZFDWX2PS01""}   {""contentId"":""QHS0ZFDWX2PS01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-07/europe-s-bond-binge-quells-demand-for-once-pivotal-stimulus""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QHS0ZFDWX2PS01""}   It’s a dramatic turnaround from April when some of Europe’s biggest firms, including Iberdrola SA and Volkswagen AG, were urging the ECB to quicken short-term debt purchases to head-off crippling cash crunches. Central banks answered the call, broadening corporate debt buying to include commercial paper and ensure firms had access to short-term cash to cover day-to-day expenses like payrolls and inventory.     {""contentId"":""QHS0ZFDWX2PS01"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-07/europe-s-bond-binge-quells-demand-for-once-pivotal-stimulus""},""containerId"":""box-XQtu4Qh""}   Since then, however, companies have binged on new longer-term debt in the bond market, issuing more than 1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) of securities with typical maturities of five years or more. Commercial paper, meanwhile, has become a virtual irrelevance in comparison, highlighting how the Covid-19 pandemic and emergency monetary measures introduced to tackle it are reordering the world’s capital markets.      #lazy-img-365109703:before{padding-top:56.25%;} Central bank purchases of commercial paper “provided good support to the market, at least at the depth of the crisis,” said Peter Kaufmann, a corporate bond analyst at Erste Group Bank AG. “As the primary market has boomed since then, short-term liquidity pressure has been alleviated.”  {""contentId"":""QHS0ZFDWX2PS01"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-07/europe-s-bond-binge-quells-demand-for-once-pivotal-stimulus""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QHS0ZFDWX2PS01""}   The outstanding amount of corporate commercial paper has slumped 30% since the end of February, based on data compiled by the ECB. It’s a similar story in the U.S., where supply has eased to the lowest since 2017.  A shrinking market for short-term debt could prompt higher borrowing costs for those remaining and also deprive borrowers of a vital cash source at times of financial market stress when other options, like the issuance of longer bonds, are no longer available.

The average euro high-grade corporate bond yield has fallen below 0.50% from March highs of more than 2% and sterling yields have nearly halved to 1.80% from 3.56%, based on Bloomberg Barclays indexes.  With so much cash now sitting on companies’ balance sheets, the ECB’s commercial paper holdings fell by almost 3 billion euros to 32 billion euros in the three months to the end of September, based on the latest quarterly breakdown of the pandemic emergency QE program, or PEPP. Meanwhile, the Bank of England’s commercial paper pool now stands at 15.7 billion pounds after falling for three consecutive weeks.
