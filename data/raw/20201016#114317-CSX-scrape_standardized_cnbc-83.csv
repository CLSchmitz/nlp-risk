The top U.S. rail regulator has ordered detailed weekly freight service reports after months of congestion that hit the grain and power industries particularly hard.CSX’s profit increase was driven by a 7 percent increase in freight volumes across most of its markets as the U.S. economy continued to grow.CSX reported earnings per share of 51 cents, up from 45 cents a year ago and beating the 48 cents expected by Wall Street analysts. Revenue for the quarter rose 8 percent from a year earlier to $3.2 billion, above the $3.15 billion analysts had forecast.The Jacksonville, Florida-based company said it expects modest earnings growth for the full year, but anticipates double-digit growth and higher profit margins in 2015.On Sunday, the Wall Street Journal reported that CSX had rebuffed a takeover bid from No. 2 Canadian railroad Canadian Pacific Railway. Such a deal would face regulatory hurdles from the STB that some analysts think would be hard to overcome.Both companies declined to comment on the report.
