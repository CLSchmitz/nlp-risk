Because the only way we lose this is by the chicanery going on relative to polling places,” the Democratic presidential nominee told supporters in Erie, Pennsylvania.    {""contentId"":""QI0A24DWLU6901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-10/biden-warns-of-potential-chicanery-at-polling-stations""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QI0A24DWLU6901""}   {""contentId"":""QI0A24DWLU6901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-10/biden-warns-of-potential-chicanery-at-polling-stations""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QI0A24DWLU6901""}   Biden later told reporters that “I’m going to accept the outcome of this election, period” and said he was referring to “attempts that are made to try to influence and scare people from voting.”    {""contentId"":""QI0A24DWLU6901"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-10/biden-warns-of-potential-chicanery-at-polling-stations""},""containerId"":""box-DXeQ1Un""}   It was a line that echoed President Donald Trump’s repeated efforts to question election integrity. The president, who’s trailing Biden in most national and battleground state polls, has suggested without evidence that mail-in ballots are subject to widespread fraud, and is preparing to potentially challenge results that don’t go his way.    “The only way we’re going to lose is if there’s mischief,” Trump said last month.  {""contentId"":""QI0A24DWLU6901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-10/biden-warns-of-potential-chicanery-at-polling-stations""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-QI0A24DWLU6901""}   Biden has been urging his supporters to vote in numbers that give him a clear victory so that Trump has no grounds to contest the outcome.  “The American people are voting and they’re voting in large numbers,” Biden told reporters, saying his earlier remark was taken out of context. “They’re going to determine the outcome and I’m going to accept the outcome of the election without any question.”  But the former vice president’s comments Saturday came off as a warning about bad things happening at polling places -- the same kind of warning for which he’s chastised Trump.  {""contentId"":""QI0A24DWLU6901"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-10/biden-warns-of-potential-chicanery-at-polling-stations""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QI0A24DWLU6901""}   At a fundraiser in July, Biden warned of the potential for “chicanery” and said his campaign had built a network of lawyers to fight for the integrity of the election.  In a September Facebook post, Donald Trump Jr, the president’s son, urged “able-bodied” supporters to join an “army for Trump’s election security.”  Biden spoke in Pennsylvania hours after a district judge there rejected the Trump campaign’s challenge to the state’s vote by mail procedures, as well as the campaign’s attempt to allow poll watchers who don’t live in the county they want to monitor.
