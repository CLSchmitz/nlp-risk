It will have the power to overrule decisions made by Facebook’s moderators and executives, including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.Following a report from The Financial Times, a spokesperson for the independent Oversight Board told CNBC that it expects to start in mid to late October. “We are currently testing the newly deployed technical systems that will allow users to appeal and the Board to review cases. Assuming those tests go to plan, we expect to open user appeals in mid to late October.”They added: “Building a process that is thorough, principled and globally effective takes time and our members have been working aggressively to launch as soon as possible.” The Oversight Board said it expects to decide on a case, and for Facebook to have acted on this decision, within a maximum of 90 days.  A spokesperson for the Oversight Board said: “In terms of passing rulings around the time of the election, the Board will be prepared to consider cases on any matters that come before it and are in scope for us, and it’s premature to guess what the Board may or may not consider until we launch. Whether Facebook will send the Board expedited cases around this time is a question for Facebook.”
