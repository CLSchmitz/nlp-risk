After meeting with the heads of BMW AG, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG, Merkel’s spokesman issued a statement committing only to further discussions of ways to support the industry. Earlier Tuesday, allies including Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said purchase subsidies should be offered for combustion-engine cars to help weather the coronavirus pandemic.    {""contentId"":""QGAJ71DWLU6M01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-08/merkel-holds-firm-against-calls-to-give-carmakers-more-state-aid""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QGAJ71DWLU6M01""}   {""contentId"":""QGAJ71DWLU6M01"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-09-08/merkel-holds-firm-against-calls-to-give-carmakers-more-state-aid""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QGAJ71DWLU6M01""}   Working groups will discuss free-market concepts to support the industry -- especially struggling suppliers -- until the group meets for another summit, Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief spokesman, said in a statement.
