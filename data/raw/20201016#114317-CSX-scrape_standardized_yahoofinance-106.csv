That diminished their holding by a very significant 100%, which arguably implies a strong desire to reallocate capital. See our latest analysis for CSX CSX Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent sale by Steven Halverson was the biggest sale of CSX shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$72.32. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was 100% of Steven Halverson's stake.You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does CSX Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that CSX insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$57m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Do The CSX Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold CSX shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. We'd think twice before buying!
