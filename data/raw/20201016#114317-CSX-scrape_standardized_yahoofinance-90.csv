Among them, Facebook and Microsoft ranked among the top 3 picks and these stocks gained 57%. Our research shows that most of the stocks that smart money likes historically generate strong risk-adjusted returns. That's why we weren't surprised when hedge funds’ top 20 large-cap stock picks generated a return of 41.1% in 2019 (through December 23rd) and outperformed the broader market benchmark by 10.1 percentage points.This is why following the smart money sentiment is a useful tool at identifying the next stock to invest in.Is CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) an attractive investment today? The smart money is becoming less confident. The number of bullish hedge fund bets were cut by 8 lately. Our calculations also showed that CSX isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q3 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q2 rankings).So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the Russell 2000 ETFs by 40 percentage points since May 2014 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren't comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in stocks that are in our short portfolio.Story continues[caption id=""attachment_26335"" align=""alignnone"" width=""600""] Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management[/caption]<img alt=""Ken Fisher FISHER ASSET MANAGEMENT"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nD5l3Ye6Be7A3hSQiKkkwQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTEyMDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w.TQCwcDEwkm7EJ44.IPqg--~B/aD03NTA7dz02MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/insidermonkey.com/f9190db683d39e32a4de71b46515207f"" class=""caas-img"">Ken Fisher FISHER ASSET MANAGEMENTWe leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example Discover is offering this insane cashback card, so we look into shorting the stock. One of the most bullish analysts in America just put his money where his mouth is. He says, ""I'm investing more today than I did back in early 2009."" So we check out his pitch. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. We even check out this option genius' weekly trade ideas. This December, we recommended Adams Energy as a one-way bet based on an under-the-radar fund manager's investor letter and the stock already gained 20 percent.
