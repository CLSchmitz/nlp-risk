(See his track record here.)The company is resilient and is likely to generate free cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2020 despite the tough backdrop, the analyst said. Wadewitz said he expects the decline in volumes in 2020 versus 2018 to be similar to the 18.6% decline in volumes witnessed in 2009 versus 2007. He further expects a similar rebound in volumes this cycle, with volume growth of 8.8% in 2021.The sharp cyclical decline in volumes gives CSX the opportunity to lower its structural costs, the analyst said.“We believe consensus is anticipating a more muted lift in 2021 and our estimate of $4.45/share implies upside vs consensus of $4.14.”CSX Price ActionShares of CSX Corp. were trading 5.44% higher at $69.55 at the time of publication Wednesday. Related Links:Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For May 20, 2020Rail Analysts Expect A Tough 6 MonthsLatest Ratings for CSXDateFirmActionFromToMay 2020UBSUpgradesNeutralBuyApr 2020UBSMaintainsBuyApr 2020Wells FargoMaintainsEqual-WeightView More Analyst Ratings for CSX  View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaAnalyst Shares Thoughts On cbdMD's Q2 Earnings: 'Sustainable Ongoing Operation'Cantor Upgrades Green Thumb Industries On Fundamentals, Relative ValuationSquare Faces Risk From Struggling Smaller Businesses, BofA Says In Double Downgrade© 2020 Benzinga.com.
