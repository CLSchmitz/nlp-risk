BNP Paribas, Société Générale and La  Banque Postale, three of the biggest banks in France, have banded  together to create Paylib, which will be available to the banks’  23 million customers, both private and institutional.   The app will be on sale from September 24, and is designed with  smartphone and tablets in mind. It aims to provide users with a  secure, as well as “simple and fluid”, means to make online  payments, foregoing the need to enter credit card details.

BNP Paribas’s head of French retail banking, Marie-Claire  Capobianco, said the first aim was to reach a “critical mass of  users, from both individuals and e-retailers”. She added that  they were advocating “an open solution, which should allow other  banks to join us, either from France or from abroad”.  “Our three banks lead an intense cooperation, but we are open to  others,” agreed Laurent Goutard, head of the retail banking  network at Société Générale.

Indeed, three other leading banks already offer their own  services, with mixed results.   Crédit Agricole launched its e-payment platform, Kwixco,  in June 2011, aiming to have over 5 million users within  four-to-five years. But the latest numbers reveal that they only  have 450,000 users and 1,200 registered retailers, none of which  are on Fevad’s top 15 list of e-retailers.    Plus, the Banque Populaire/Caisse d’Epargne partnership has also  yielded lukewarm results.  However, Paylib plans to compete on costs, charging retailers a  commission below 3 percent, the rate currently charged by Paypal.  So far, it has worked — eight of the 15 biggest e-retailers in  France, including  Showroomprivé.com and  Voyages-SNCF.com plan to carry the app’s logo on their websites.  Paylib now wants to go further by encouraging their business  clients “of all sizes” to register.   (Read more: Don’t be afraid, recovery takes time: Soc Gen CEO)"
