It also faces more competition on some routes after giving up slots as an EU aid condition.Story continuesBrussels Airlines will cut its fleet and workforce by 25-30% while Austrian reduces wage costs by 20%, Lufthansa has said. The group posted a 2.1 billion-euro first-quarter loss and said it was consuming 800 million euros in cash per month.Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has hailed the coronavirus shakeup as a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity for the low-cost giant at the expense of bailed-out rivals.""A problem with the state aid subsidy is they all come with costs (that) prevent those airlines engaging in meaningful labour reform or productivity gains,"" he said last month.Echoing that sentiment, Wizz Air outlined plans to fly 60% of its summer capacity and 80% from September, while cutting 1,000 of its 5,000-strong workforce. Underlying net profit rose 30% to 345 million euros for the year ending March 30, the company said, stressing its ample cash reserves.""We seem to be one of the most resilent airlines in the world,"" CEO Varadi said. ""If we don't fly a single service ... for the next 24 months we are still in business.""($1 = 0.8924 euros)(Reporting by Ludwig Burger and Sarah Young; Additional reporting Ilona Wissenbach and Alexander Cornwell; Writing by Laurence Frost; Editing by Keith Weir)"
