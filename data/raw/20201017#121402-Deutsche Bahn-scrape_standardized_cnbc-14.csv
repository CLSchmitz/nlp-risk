Existing investors Balderton Capital, Creandum and Raine Ventures also invested. It comes just eight months after the firm last raised money.“Already now we have seen seasonable profitability in some cities,” Fredrik Hjelm, Voi’s co-founder and CEO, told CNBC in an interview. “Next year we want to have a bunch of cities that are profitable over the whole year. And by 2021-2022, we should be profitable on a company basis.”Voi’s funding round comes against a backdrop of rising wariness among investors about high-flying, high-spending start-ups that lack a clear plan for how they’re going to generate profits.In order to break even, Voi says it will use the fresh capital to ramp up work on its kick scooters to extend their lifespan. It will also fund the development of software to better understand where to place the vehicles overnight and see how users are parking them.
