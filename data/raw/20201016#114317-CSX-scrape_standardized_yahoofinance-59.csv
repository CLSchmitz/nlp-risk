The recent drop has obliterated the annual return, with the share price now down 27% over that longer period.All else being equal, a share price drop should make a stock more attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that long term investors have an opportunity when expectations of a company are too low. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. Check out our latest analysis for CSX Does CSX Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 12.77 that sentiment around CSX isn't particularly high. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (15.8) for companies in the transportation industry is higher than CSX's P/E.<img alt=""NasdaqGS:CSX Price Estimation Relative to Market, March 13th 2020"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZW1hLs.eEkcQBtLhf.tcnA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/5643b67ade67fe70705f89ae28c2928d"" class=""caas-img"">NasdaqGS:CSX Price Estimation Relative to Market, March 13th 2020This suggests that market participants think CSX will underperform other companies in its industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Story continuesCSX's earnings per share grew by -8.4% in the last twelve months. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 17% per year over the last five years.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does CSX's Balance Sheet Tell Us?CSX's net debt equates to 32% of its market capitalization. You'd want to be aware of this fact, but it doesn't bother us.The Bottom Line On CSX's P/E RatioCSX's P/E is 12.8 which is about average (13.3) in the US market. When you consider the modest EPS growth last year (along with some debt), it seems the market thinks the growth is sustainable. Given CSX's P/E ratio has declined from 19.0 to 12.8 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is significantly less confident about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
