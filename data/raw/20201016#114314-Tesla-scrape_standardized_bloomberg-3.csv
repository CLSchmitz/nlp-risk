On Friday, it announced its first electric vehicle chassis as well as a software platform that is aimed at helping EV makers deliver models to the market faster. The company also outlined plans to release a solid-state battery by 2024 that could potentially displace the more commonly used lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles.      #lazy-img-365333003:before{padding-top:56.25%;} Hon Hai’ electric vehicle chassis.

Apple Inc. still accounts for about 50% of overall sales of Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, but the company is seeking to diversify from its role as the assembler of consumer electronic goods like Macbooks and Sony Playstations.    {""contentId"":""QI6W6LT0G1L201"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/foxconn-expands-its-automotive-business-to-boost-future-growth""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-QI6W6LT0G1L201""}   {""contentId"":""QI6W6LT0G1L201"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/foxconn-expands-its-automotive-business-to-boost-future-growth""},""containerId"":""box-0DhD8R1""}   The company is targeting a 10% share of the EV market by as early as 2025, with around 3 million vehicles using its platform, Liu told reporters on Friday.    {""contentId"":""QI6W6LT0G1L201"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-16/foxconn-expands-its-automotive-business-to-boost-future-growth""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-QI6W6LT0G1L201""}   Hon Hai said earlier this year it will create a joint venture with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to develop and make electric vehicles in China.
