CDC, as the bank is known, and Veolia, the world’s biggest water company, plan to sell shares in the joint company called Veolia Transdev in an initial public offering within 12 months of closing the deal, according to an e-mailed statement.    {""contentId"":""L1Y4UU0UQVI901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[1,8]],""small_desktop"":[[1,8]],""tablet"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-05-05/caisse-des-depots-veolia-to-merge-public-transport-divisions-list-unit""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-1-L1Y4UU0UQVI901""}   {""contentId"":""L1Y4UU0UQVI901"",""position"":""outstream"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[1,8]]},""strategy"":""always"",""type"":""Outstream Video Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""outstream"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-05-05/caisse-des-depots-veolia-to-merge-public-transport-divisions-list-unit""},""containerId"":""outstream-video-2-L1Y4UU0UQVI901""}   The IPO could raise “in the range” of 500 million euros ($647 million) and give the company an equity value of about 1.4 billion euros, Veolia’s Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Francois Riolacci said on a conference call with analysts.    {""contentId"":""L1Y4UU0UQVI901"",""position"":""box"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""Mobile Body Box Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""box1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2010-05-05/caisse-des-depots-veolia-to-merge-public-transport-divisions-list-unit""},""containerId"":""box-1UElcxF""}   Veolia dropped as much as 1.5 percent in Paris and was 1 percent lower at 23.40 euros as of 2:16 p.m. local time.    “Unlike the market’s original view that this transaction reduces exposure to the business, as the details are fleshed out it is clear this is not the case,” Sofia Savvantidou, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a report, referring to Veolia’s exposure to transport, a business “with few synergies with the rest of its asset portfolio and which has traditionally underperformed expectations.”   Veolia and the CDC have been in talks for about a year on merging their transport divisions, which will compete in the liberalizing European bus and railway market with the Deutsche Bahn AG-Arriva Plc merged company and French rival Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais. Veolia operates buses, trains and subways in 28 countries through its transport division, the company’s smallest by sales.  {""contentId"":""L1Y4UU0UQVI901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article1"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-05-05/caisse-des-depots-veolia-to-merge-public-transport-divisions-list-unit""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-1-L1Y4UU0UQVI901""}   Sell Assets  Veolia Transdev may have to sell “some assets” in the Netherlands, where it has more than half of the segment of the market open to private operators, Veolia Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot said at a news conference. “We may be asked to lighten” the holdings, he said, referring to a possible request from the European Commission in exchange for approving the deal.  {""contentId"":""L1Y4UU0UQVI901"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2010-05-05/caisse-des-depots-veolia-to-merge-public-transport-divisions-list-unit""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-L1Y4UU0UQVI901""}   Approval could come in September at the earliest and may be delayed to the start of 2011 should EU antitrust regulators ask for an in-depth study of the agreement, he said. The IPO could be delayed if that happens to the start of 2012.  The CDC and Veolia want to remain “major shareholders” in the company, although the size of the share sale hasn’t been decided, Frerot said.  Cost Savings  Combining Veolia’s transport division and Transdev will create cost savings of about 70 million euros a year, the statement said. Priority markets for the merged company will be Germany, the Netherlands, U.K. and U.S., executives said.  The joint company had pro forma revenue of 8.1 billion euros, 117,000 employees worldwide and cash flow from operations of about 500 million euros last year. It will require average annual investment of 400 million to 500 million euros and will have a “high” debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ratio, Riolacci said. Debt is about 1.8 billion euros.  Sales will grow about 6 percent through 2015, CDC Chief Executive Officer Augustin de Romanet said.  {""contentId"":""L1Y4UU0UQVI901"",""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""large_desktop"":[[5,4]],""small_desktop"":[[5,4]]},""type"":""Desktop in article Native Ad"",""targeting"":{""position"":""desktop-in-article2"",""url"":""/news/articles/2010-05-05/caisse-des-depots-veolia-to-merge-public-transport-divisions-list-unit""},""containerId"":""desktop-in-article-2-L1Y4UU0UQVI901""}   The new company is expected to outperform European transport market growth of about 5 percent, Riolacci said. Veolia estimates the global transport business is worth about 340 billion euros, of which about one third is open to private operators.  Self-financing  Veolia will have operational control of the planned company, which will be “self-financing” following the share sale, Riolacci said.  {""contentId"":""L1Y4UU0UQVI901"",""position"":""in-article2"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article2"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2010-05-05/caisse-des-depots-veolia-to-merge-public-transport-divisions-list-unit""},""containerId"":""in-article-2-L1Y4UU0UQVI901""}   The operator of the Paris mass-transport system, which owns 25.6 percent of Transdev, will exchange its stake for London United Busways and Bournemouth Transport in the U.K. as well as assets in France, Italy and Switzerland, the RATP said in a statement. Sales of the transferred assets reached 340 million euros last year.  Transdev, currently 69.6 percent owned by the CDC, is the fourth-largest private operator of public transport in Europe. It provides about a fifth of urban public services in France outside of Paris and runs transport companies in Portugal, Spain and the U.K.  Veolia’s Frerot will be chairman of the new company, while Transdev CEO Joel Lebreton will take up the same role at the combined entity and Cyrille du Peloux, currently head of Veolia Transport, will become his deputy.
