The railway company also decided not to grant any building contracts for the project for the moment, the newspaper said, citing Deutsche Bahn. The company will try to start talks with the new state government in May, Handelsblatt said.    Baden-Wuerttemberg may face damage claims if the new state government cancels the Stuttgart 21 project, Handelsblatt reported, citing German Transport Minister Peter Ramsauer.
