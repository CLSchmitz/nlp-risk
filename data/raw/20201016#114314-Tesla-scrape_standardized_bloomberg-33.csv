Daimler AG’s main division will aim for a return on sales in the mid to high single-digit range by 2025, even if market conditions are unfavorable. Its goal will be to earn a double-digit profit margin if the sales environment is strong.      #lazy-img-365114202:before{padding-top:67.19999999999999%;} Ola Kallenius Photographer: Michaela Handrek-Rehle/Bloomberg      Explore dynamic updates of the earth’s key data points       Open the Data Dash     Close              50,​820    Million metric tons of greenhouse emissions, most recent annual data     +0.​97° C   Sep. 2020 increase in global temperature vs. 1900s average          0   8   7   6   5   4    0   6   5   4   3   2    0   5   4   3   2   1     Soccer pitches of forest lost this hour, most recent data          Meerut, India Most polluted air today, in sensor range        0   6   5   4   3   2    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   4   3   2   1   0   .   0   0   9   8   7   6    0   2   1   0   9   8    0   3   2   1   0   9    0   8   7   6   5   4    0   4   3   2   1   0    0   7   6   5   4   3     Parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere       80%   Carbon-free net power in Brazil, most recent data           $69.​9B    Renewable power investment worldwide in Q2 2020     -38.​64%   Today's arctic ice area vs. historic average       {""contentId"":""QHQEP5T1UM1001"",""position"":""greensponsoredby"",""dimensions"":{""small_desktop"":[[190,31]],""large_desktop"":[[190,31]],""tablet"":[[190,31]],""mobile"":[[190,31]]},""positionIncrement"":2,""targeting"":{""position"":""greensponsoredby2"",""positionIncrement"":2,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-06/mercedes-maps-out-push-to-lift-profits-during-electric-car-shift""},""containerId"":""greensponsoredby-VArwSU4""}   “We have not yet lived up to our full potential in terms of turning volume success into profit growth,” Chief Executive Officer Ola Kallenius said in a statement ahead of a capital markets day presentation.

Tesla is worth almost $400 billion.    #lazy-img-365110986:before{padding-top:56.25%;} Mercedes has cut its employee count by about 3,800 positions this year as of August and slimmed fixed costs down by 12%. It’s targeting more than a 20% reduction in costs by 2025 compared with last year by shrinking production capacity and personnel expenses.  {""contentId"":""QHQEP5T1UM1001"",""position"":""in-article1"",""dimensions"":{""mobile"":[[5,19],[300,250],[3,3],[1,1],""fluid""],""tablet"":[[5,11],[728,90],[1,1]]},""type"":""In Article Flex Native Ad"",""positionIncrement"":1,""targeting"":{""position"":""in-article1"",""positionIncrement"":1,""url"":""/news/articles/2020-10-06/mercedes-maps-out-push-to-lift-profits-during-electric-car-shift""},""containerId"":""in-article-1-QHQEP5T1UM1001""}   The high-performance AMG brand will debut an electrified model next year. The Maybach brand, which Kallenius hinted in an interview last month would go electric, will double in size.  Electric Shift  By the end of the decade, more than half of Mercedes’s global sales will be electrified, while the number of combustion engine variants will fall by 70%. Battery costs are dropping faster than expected, the company said, so high-end EVs will be solidly profitable from the start and new architectures will contribute to margins by the middle of the decade.  “We strive for nothing less than taking the lead in electric drive and car software,” Markus Schaefer, chief operating officer of Mercedes, said in the statement. The company will offer over-the-air upgrades similar to what Tesla has offered its customers and sees digital services bringing in 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) of earnings before interest and taxes by 2025.  Outperforming Peers  Daimler has 13 buy ratings among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, followed by 11 holds and seven recommendations to sell the stock. The stock slipped 3.1% this year through the close of trading Monday, outperforming larger German peer Volkswagen AG and arch rival BMW AG.  Mercedes has flanked its all-electric EQC SUV with a battery-powered minivan dubbed EQV. It plans to start output of the compact EQA hatchback later this year and rolled out a fresh version of its flagship S-Class last month. The sedan will get a fully-electric sibling dubbed EQS next year, which will be based on the company’s first dedicated electric-car platform. An architecture for compact and medium-size cars is coming in 2025.  Profits from large luxury cars will be key to financing restructuring costs aimed at making Mercedes more efficient. The brand has outsold luxury-car rivals for years, but returns have slumped below the level of mass-market peers such as PSA Group.
