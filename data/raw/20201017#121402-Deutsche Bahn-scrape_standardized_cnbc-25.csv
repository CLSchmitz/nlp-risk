Hundreds of heavy trucks slowed to a crawl on  diverted routes into Germany’s fourth-largest city. The usual bridge crossing  over the Rhine from Leverkusen into Cologne could no longer  support their weight.  “When you see steel breaking, the steel ripping apart, then you  get an idea of what it means to have an old bridge in desperate  need of repair,” said Ernst Grigat, head of chemical facility  operator Chempark, which runs three industrial complexes in  Germany including one in Leverkusen.  Crumbling bridges and traffic jams are staining Germany’s global  reputation for efficiency. The infrastructure in Europe’s largest  economy — as in the United States — has been slowly  deteriorating from a lack of investment over the past few  decades. Now the budget-conscious German government is stepping  up efforts to rebuild the country’s roads, bridges, railways and  waterways before it’s too late. "
