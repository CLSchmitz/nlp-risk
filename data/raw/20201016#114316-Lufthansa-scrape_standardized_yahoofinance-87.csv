""If no new competitor makes use of this option, it will be extended to existing competitors at the respective airports.""The previous deal had included forfeiting 72 slots used by 12 of 300 jets based at the Frankfurt and Munich airports, a source familiar with the matter said.INTERMEDIATE STEPThe slots, to be allocated in a bidding process, can be taken over only by a European peer that has not received any substantial state aid during the pandemic, Lufthansa said.The Commision said once it has been officially notified by Germany on the aid package it will assess the issue as a matter of priority.""(Lufthansa's remedies will) enable a viable entry or expansion of activities by other airlines at these airports to the benefit of consumers and effective competition,"" it said in a statement.Story continuesThe airline's supervisory board needs to approve the deal, Lufthansa said, adding it would convene an extraordinary general meeting to obtain shareholder approval for the bailout.The largest German corporate rescue since the coronavirus crisis struck will see the government get a 20% stake in Lufthansa, which could rise to 25% plus one share in the event of a takeover attempt. A deal would also give the government two seats on Lufthansa's supervisory board.Rivals such as Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM and U.S. carriers American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines are all seeking state aid due to the economic effects of the pandemic.Germany, which has set up a 100 billion euro fund to take stakes in companies hit by the pandemic, said it plans to sell the Lufthansa stake by the end of 2023.""The German government, Lufthansa and the European Commission have reached an important intermediate step in the aid negotiations,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement.It said talks with the Commission over state aid would continue.($1 = 0.9011 euros)(Additional reporting by Christian Kraemer and Yun Chee Foo; Editing by Sabine Wollrab, Sandra Maler, Jonathan Oatis and Will Dunham)"
