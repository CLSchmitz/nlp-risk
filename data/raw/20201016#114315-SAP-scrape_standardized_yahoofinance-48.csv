Even though it isn't the intention, these filings to a certain extent level the playing field for ordinary investors. The latest round of 13F filings disclosed the funds' positions on March 31st, about a week after the S&P 500 Index bottomed. We at Insider Monkey have made an extensive database of more than 821 of those established hedge funds and famous value investors' filings. In this article, we analyze how these elite funds and prominent investors traded SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) based on those filings.SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) has experienced a decrease in support from the world's most elite money managers lately. SAP was in 15 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2020. There were 16 hedge funds in our database with SAP positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that SAP isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks).  Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 58 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.Story continues[caption id=""attachment_839199"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""395""] Rajiv Jain of GQG Partners[/caption]<img alt=""Rajiv Jain of GQG Partners"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pYH3PNVzB5YPeZ4Duzxaww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Yip3GLeov0vijX.Y4Pfadg--~B/aD0yMTAwO3c9MjEwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/insidermonkey.com/cc7a854c35048cc8156af4b4fcb9a802"" class=""caas-img"">Rajiv Jain of GQG PartnersAt Insider Monkey we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, we take a look at lists like the 10 largest producers of bauxite to identify emerging trends that are likely to lead to 1000% gains in the coming years. We interview hedge fund managers and ask them about their best ideas. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. For example we are checking out stocks recommended/scorned by legendary Bill Miller. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when the S&P 500 was trading at 3150 in February after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors.
